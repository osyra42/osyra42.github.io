    <header><h3>About Me</h3></header>
    <section>
      <pre>
I'm a multidisciplinary digital creator who bridges code, art, and storytelling into cohesive experiences. Over the past eight years, I've built everything from AI-powered Discord bots with VTuber avatars to interactive educational tools, custom 3D-printed designs, and published fantasy novels. My work spans web development, 3D character modeling and rigging, procedural worksheet generators, Minecraft server management, and AI integration—all designed, built, and maintained solo.

What drives me is the challenge of making complex systems accessible and expressive. Whether I'm training an AI to respond with personality, architecting a Discord bot that's evolved through eight major iterations, designing canvas-based math worksheets for teachers, or creating fully-rigged VTuber models, I approach each project as an opportunity to solve real problems while exploring new technical frontiers. My portfolio reflects a commitment to craftsmanship, iterative improvement, and sharing knowledge with the community through guides, open services, and thoughtfully-documented tools.

    <header><h3>What I Build</h3></header>
    <section>
      <p>
        <b>Educational Tools</b><br>
        I've developed interactive canvas-based worksheets for arithmetic, measurements, and currency counting. These tools generate randomized problems with multi-page print support, making them perfect for teachers and homeschooling parents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>AI & Automation</b><br>
        Vanity is my custom-built Discord bot featuring AI research capabilities, music integration, and real-time responses. I designed and maintain the entire system, from API integrations to command handling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Creative Writing</b><br>
        As an author, I write sci-fi and fantasy stories including Infinite Devastation, Ever Diamond, and my ongoing series Osyra's Tale. My narratives explore complex worlds, ethical questions, and character-driven adventures.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Developer Tools</b><br>
        I create practical utilities like Media Mimic (a Python-based media organizer) and maintain a curated research repository with resources for developers looking to streamline their workflows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Gaming & Community</b><br>
        I run a Minecraft server with custom configurations and modpacks like All The Mods 10. I handle everything from server management to sharing seasonal archives for the community.
