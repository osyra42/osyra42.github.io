# Chapter 36

The two hunters, an older man named Earl and his teenage grandson, Leo, sat in a sterile, soundproofed room on a lower deck of The Bastion. They looked small and bewildered under the bright lights, their flannel shirts and worn jeans a stark contrast to the polished metal surroundings. A woman in a sharp, charcoal-gray suit, a PR spokesperson named Aliana, sat across from them, her smile professional and placating.

'Thank you for your patience," she began, her voice smooth as silk. 'We understand you've been through a traumatic event. We'd just like to clarify a few details for our report."

Earl, his face a roadmap of wrinkles, grunted. 'Ain't much to clarify. We saw what we saw. There was a monster. Then there was... something else."

'The other one," Leo whispered, his eyes wide, fixed on the table. 'She had... ears. And a tail. Like a wolf."

Aliana's smile was a masterpiece of benign condescension. 'The mind is a powerful thing, especially under extreme stress. It's not uncommon for it to project more... archetypal imagery onto a confusing situation. Are you certain you didn't see one of our highly trained operatives in advanced ghillie-style tactical gear? The hoods can sometimes create a silhouette that the brain misinterprets."

Leo looked up, doubt creeping into his expression. The woman's calm certainty was eroding the edges of his terrifyingly clear memory.

'And the other... individual?" Aliana pressed gently. 'The one you described as ‘metal'?"

'She tore its arm off," Earl stated flatly, his voice rough. 'Just... ripped it right out. Didn't even flinch."

'Ah, yes, our new forestry and rescue prototype," Aliana said, nodding as if he'd described a common power tool. 'It's equipped with industrial-grade hydraulic cutters for clearing fallen trees and performing emergency extractions. The force can be quite shocking to witness if you're not familiar with the technology. The creature you encountered was likely a bear, a very sick one, suffering from a severe parasitic infection that causes extreme emaciation and can lead to aggressive, unnatural-seeming behavior."

She slid two non-disclosure agreements across the table, along with two checks with a staggering number of zeros. 'This is for your trouble, and to compensate you for the shock. And to ensure the public isn't alarmed by a simple, if tragic, wildlife incident."

Earl looked at the check, then at his grandson. The story of the sick bear was sane. It was the kind of story you could tell your friends at the diner. The memory of the wolf-woman's feral glare and the android's effortless violence was already being boxed away as a strange dream. He picked up the pen.

In his office, Kael watched the feed of the debriefing on a monitor before turning to Osyra and Vanity. 'It's handled. The ‘sick bear' story will hold." He turned to his main terminal. 'But we have a more pressing lead. We've been digging, following the legal trail Vanity's... inquiry... has started to uncover. We found a trace on Layla Null."

Osyra's posture straightened, her lupine ears swiveling forward intently. Vanity's optical sensors brightened to a piercing violet.

'Her last confirmed public location before she vanished wasn't at a major facility," Kael continued, pulling up a map of a vast, arid region. 'It was at a remote, privately-owned biological research outpost called the ‘Aetherius Observatory,' nestled in the high desert canyons near the border. It was officially decommissioned years ago due to ‘funding cuts' and ‘structural instability.'"

'A cover," Osyra stated, her voice low. She remembered the name. It was a pet project, a place for highly speculative, fringe research that the main facility wouldn't touch. The kind of place you sent things you wanted to forget.

'Undoubtedly. Satellite imagery shows the place has been a ghost town for a decade. But in the last six months, our signals intelligence has picked up intermittent, encrypted, low-power bursts. Short-range, directional. Someone is using the place sporadically, and they don't want to be heard." He zoomed in on the map, revealing a cluster of low, sand-colored buildings nestled at the base of a towering mesa. 'And there's your in. The local ranchers' association has put out a contract. Livestock losses. The descriptions don't match coyotes or mountain lions. They describe something fast, hairless, with spines along its back, that leaves two puncture wounds on the neck and drains the animals completely."

'A Chupacabra," Osyra said, the folkloric name feeling both absurd and chillingly appropriate.

'Or a reasonable facsimile," Kael agreed. 'You'll be a specialized pest-control team from an out-of-state firm, hired by the association. It gives you a legitimate reason to be in the area, asking questions, and poking around the edges of that mesa. Your primary objective is to get inside that observatory. The creature is secondary, but if you encounter it, eliminate it. The last thing we need is more panic or drawn-out attention."

He looked from Osyra to Vanity. 'This is the closest we've been. Find out what happened at that observatory. Find a trace of that girl. Dismissed."

The journey was a study in harsh transitions. The cool, controlled environment of The Bastion was replaced by the dry, baking heat of the high desert. They traveled in a rugged, unmarked truck, kicking up plumes of red dust on long, lonely roads. The air smelled of sagebrush, hot stone, and distance.

Vanity drove, her hands perfectly steady on the wheel, her sensors constantly scanning the horizon. Osyra sat in the passenger seat, her tail flicking occasionally in restless agitation. The wide-open space was both a relief and a vulnerability after the claustrophobic woods.

They made contact with the head of the ranchers' association, a grizzled man named Jessup, at a dusty roadside diner. He looked them over with a skeptical eye, lingering on Osyra's sharp features before shrugging.

'Long as you get the job done," he'd grumbled, pointing a thick finger toward the distant mesa. 'Something's holed up around there. Lost three calves last week. Cleaned ‘em out. Not a drop of blood left. Never seen anything like it. You find it, you kill it."

Now, as the sun began to dip below the horizon, painting the sky in shades of orange and purple, they turned off the main road onto a rutted track that led toward the monolithic shadow of the mesa. The "official" plan was to find a place to set up a base camp and begin the predator hunt at first light.

But as the observatory buildings came into view—low, domed structures of stained concrete, their windows dark and empty—both of them knew the hunt had already begun. The place was a silent scar on the landscape. A single, rusted communications dish on the main building's roof tilted at a drunken angle against the darkening sky.

Vanity brought the truck to a stop a half-mile out, concealing it behind a rocky outcrop. The only sound was the cooling engine ticking and the whisper of the wind over stone.

'The energy signatures were last detected in the central structure," Vanity stated, her violet eyes fixed on the complex. 'There are no current thermal signs of life. But the dust patterns near the main vehicle bay door are disturbed. Recently."

Osyra nodded, her own enhanced senses picking up the subtle, wrong notes in the environment. The silence was too complete. No crickets, no rustle of lizards. It was the same predatory stillness she'd felt in the woods.

They had arrived. Before them lay the Aetherius Observatory, a tomb holding the secrets of Layla Null's disappearance. And somewhere in the vast, darkening desert around it, something that drank blood was hunting.
