# Chapter 14 - A New Opportunity

It had been over a year since I'd thrown myself fully into my work—a year of pushing harder, faster, further.  
I didn't have time to dwell on the past. I didn't have time to dwell on anything. My research was my life now,  
and I was determined to make it count.  
But today, that determination had hit a wall.  
My latest paper had been rejected. Not just rejected—failed. The email from my professor had been polite  
but firm: While your ideas are creative, they lack scientific rigor and fail to address the ethical implications of  
such research.  
Creative. That word stung more than the F. I wasn't trying to be creative. I was trying to be groundbreaking.  
The paper had been my obsession for months. The idea that a virus could be engineered to alter human  
DNA, to introduce animal traits—it was radical, sure, but it wasn't impossible. At least, not in my head. I'd  
spent countless hours researching, drafting, and revising, convinced that this could be my breakthrough.  
And now it was being dismissed as 'creative but insufficient."  
I'd requested an appeal, of course. I wasn't the type to back down, not when I knew I was right. But as I sat  
in the sterile, fluorescent-lit hallway outside the department head's office, waiting for my meeting, I couldn't  
shake the feeling that something was off.  
The door opened, and Dr. Langston, the department head, stepped out. His expression was unreadable, but  
there was something in his eyes—something that made my stomach twist.  
'Ms. Renaya," he said, gesturing for me to come in. 'We're ready for you."  
I stood, smoothing my hands over my skirt as I followed him into the office. The room was large and  
impeccably clean, with floor-to-ceiling windows that overlooked the campus. But it wasn't the view that caught  
my attention.  
There was a man sitting in one of the chairs across from Dr. Langston's desk. He was older, maybe in his  
late forties, with sharp features and piercing blue eyes. He was dressed in a sleek, tailored suit, the kind that  
screamed money and power. He didn't look like a professor.  
I froze in the doorway, my heart pounding. Something about him set off every alarm bell in my head.  
'Ms. Renaya," Dr. Langston said, gesturing to the empty chair. 'Please, have a seat."  
I sat down slowly, my eyes flicking between the two men. The stranger was watching me intently, his gaze  
calculating. It made my skin crawl.  
'This is Mr. Grayson," Dr. Langston said, nodding toward the man. 'He's... taken an interest in your paper."  
I frowned, my stomach tightening. 'My paper?"  
Mr. Grayson leaned forward, his hands clasped in front of him. 'Yes, Ms. Renaya. Your work on viral  
vectors and genetic modification is... intriguing, to say the least. I'd like to discuss it with you further."  
I glanced at Dr. Langston, but his expression gave nothing away. 'I... I'm not sure I understand," I said  
slowly.  
Mr. Grayson smiled, but it didn't reach his eyes. 'Let's just say I'm in a position to recognize potential when  
I see it. And your ideas, while unorthodox, have a certain... appeal."  
I felt a flicker of hope, but it was quickly overshadowed by suspicion. This didn't feel right.  
'What exactly are you proposing?" I asked, my voice steady despite the unease creeping up my spine.  
Mr. Grayson's smile widened. 'I'm offering you an opportunity, Ms. Renaya. A chance to take your research  
to the next level. But it's not something we can discuss here."  
He turned to Dr. Langston, his tone firm. 'If you don't mind, I'd like to speak with Ms. Renaya alone."  
Dr. Langston hesitated for a moment, then nodded. 'Of course. I'll be outside if you need me."  
He stood and left the room, closing the door behind him. The sound of it clicking shut made my heart skip a  
beat.  
Mr. Grayson leaned back in his chair, his gaze never leaving mine. 'So, Ms. Renaya. Are you interested?"  
I swallowed hard, my mind racing. This was insane. Meeting a stranger in some undisclosed location? It  
sounded like the setup for a bad thriller movie.  
But at the same time... this could be my chance. My real chance.  
'I... I think so," I said hesitantly. 'But I need to know more."  
Mr. Grayson nodded, as if he'd expected that answer. 'Of course. But first, there's something I need to do."  
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a small black sack and a pair of plastic zip ties. My breath caught  
in my throat.  
'W-what are those for?" I asked, my voice trembling.  
'Just a precaution," he said calmly, standing and moving behind me. Before I could react, he slipped the  
sack over my head, plunging me into darkness.  
I gasped, my hands instinctively reaching up to pull it off, but he caught my wrists, binding them together  
with the zip ties.  
'Wh-what are you doing?" I stammered, my heart pounding in my chest.  
'It's just a precaution," he repeated, his voice calm and steady. 'You'll understand soon."  
I felt a sharp pinch in my arm, and then everything went black.  
When I woke up, the first thing I noticed was the bed.  
It was soft—softer than any bed I'd ever slept in. The sheets were smooth and cool against my skin, and the  
pillows were perfectly fluffed. For a moment, I thought I was back home, in my room at the estate.  
But as my eyes adjusted to the light, I realized this wasn't my room.  
The walls were stark white, the furniture sleek and modern. Everything was clean—sterile, almost. There  
were no windows, but the room was brightly lit, the light source hidden somewhere in the ceiling.  
I sat up slowly, my head spinning. My hands were free, and there were no restraints on the bed. I wasn't  
tied down. I wasn't locked in.  
I looked down at myself. My shoes were still on, and I was still wearing my lab coat. I patted my pockets,  
relieved to find my wallet still there. I pulled it out and checked the contents—cash, cards, ID, everything was in  
place.  
I swung my legs over the side of the bed, my shoes tapping the floor. The room was silent, the only sound  
the faint hum of the lights above.  
I stood, my legs shaky but steady enough to walk. My body felt stiff, like I'd been lying still for hours, but  
there was no pain, no signs of injury.  
I glanced around the room, taking in the details. There was a desk in the corner, neatly organized with  
pens, papers, and a stack of notebooks. A bottle of water and a small package of dry food—granola bars, by the  
looks of it—sat on the edge of the desk.  
I walked over, my footsteps echoing in the quiet room. The desk was stocked with everything I might  
need—pens, pencils, a ruler, even a small calculator. It was like someone had anticipated my every need.  
I picked up the bottle of water, twisting off the cap and taking a sip. It was cool and refreshing, and I  
realized how dry my throat felt.  
I thought I was a prisoner. This didn't feel like prison.  
But as I explored the room, the unease in my chest grew. Where was I? And what did Mr. Grayson want  
with me?  
I didn't have answers. But as I sat down at the desk, staring at the neatly arranged supplies, I couldn't shake  
the feeling that my life was about to change—whether I wanted it to or not.
