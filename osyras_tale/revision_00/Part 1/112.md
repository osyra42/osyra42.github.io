# Chapter 12 - It's Mitosis

It's been weeks—maybe even months—since the incident. I refuse to call it a breakdown, even in my own head. Time has a way of blurring together when you're busy, and I've been nothing if not busy. The weight on my chest has lightened, and the constant buzzing in my brain has quieted to a dull hum. I'm functional again, which is all that really matters. I've thrown myself back into my studies, burying myself in textbooks and lab work like nothing happened. It's easier that way. If I keep moving, keep working, I don't have to think about how close I came to falling apart.

But Taylor... Taylor's still there. She's been messaging me every day since that night, sending me random memes and asking how I'm doing. It's weird. I'm not used to people checking in on me. Derran used to do it, back when I lived at home, but even that felt more like his job than anything else. Taylor doesn't have to care. She doesn't have to keep texting me, especially after I spent years rolling my eyes at her and dismissing her as shallow. But she does. And for some reason, I keep responding.

I don't know how to talk to her, though. Not really. I'm not good at small talk or casual conversations. I don't know how to be normal. So, I do the only thing I know how to do: I send her pictures of things I think are cool and explain them. It's not much, but it's something.

Today, it's a slide of a plant cell undergoing mitosis. I snapped the photo during lab and spent way too long editing it to make sure the details were clear. The cell is in the middle of splitting, the chromosomes neatly aligned, the spindle fibers pulling everything apart with perfect precision. It's beautiful, in a way. Life, reduced to its most basic process. I attach the photo to a message and type out an explanation before I can overthink it.

Me: Look at this. It's a plant cell in the middle of mitosis. See how the chromosomes are lined up? That's the metaphase stage. The spindle fibers are pulling them apart so each new cell gets an identical set. It's like... the ultimate form of replication. Perfect symmetry.

I hit send before I can second-guess myself. Taylor probably doesn't care about mitosis. She probably doesn't even know what it is. But she responds almost immediately.

Taylor: OMG that's so cool!! It's like the cell is doing a little dance, right?? Like, twirling around and splitting into two??

I stare at her message, my lips twitching into a faint smile. A dance. I've never thought of it that way before, but in a way, she's not wrong. The cell is moving, spinning, dividing itself with a kind of grace. It's not the scientific explanation I'd give, but it's... nice.

Me: Yeah, I guess you could say that. It's more like a carefully choreographed routine, though. Every step has to be perfect, or the whole thing falls apart.

Taylor: That's so pretty!! You're, like, a science poet or something.

I snort, shaking my head. A science poet. That's a new one.

Me: Hardly. It's just biology.

Taylor: No, seriously!! You make it sound so cool. I could never do what you do. Like, I'd just be staring at the slide going, 'Uh... it's green?"

I laugh despite myself. Taylor's never been one for academics, but she has a way of making even the most mundane things sound entertaining.

Me: It's not that hard. You just have to know what you're looking for.

Taylor: Yeah, but you know what you're looking for. That's the cool part. You're, like, a science wizard or something.

I don't know how to respond to that. I'm not used to people complimenting me, especially not about my work. It feels... strange. But not entirely unpleasant.

Me: Thanks, I guess.

Taylor: No problem!! You're amazing, Osyra. Don't forget that.

I stare at her message, my chest tightening. I don't know what to say. I'm not amazing. I'm just... me. But Taylor's words linger in my mind, a small flicker of warmth in the cold, empty space I've built around myself.

I don't know how to talk to normal people. I don't know how to be the kind of person who has friends, who shares things, who lets people in. But maybe... maybe I don't have to figure it all out right now. Maybe I can just keep sending Taylor pictures of cells and let her call me a science wizard. It's not much, but it's something.

The notification popped up on my screen, pulling me out of my thoughts. A new friend request. I frowned, my finger hovering over the screen. Derran? Since when did Derran have a Facebook account? This had to be a mistake—or worse, some kind of scam. Derran wasn't exactly the type to dive into social media. He was more of a 'polished silverware and perfectly pressed suits" kind of guy.

I stared at the profile picture. It was him, all right. That calm, composed expression, the tailored suit, the faint smile that always seemed to say, I know more than you think I do. But still, I had to be sure. I couldn't just accept a random friend request, even if it looked like him.

I scrolled through my contacts until I found his number and hit dial. The phone rang twice before he answered, his voice as steady and polite as ever.

'Good evening, Lady Osyra. To what do I owe the pleasure?"

I didn't bother with small talk. 'Hey, Derran. Did you send a friend request to me on Facebook?"

There was a brief pause on the other end, and I could almost picture him raising an eyebrow, that faint smile playing on his lips. 'Yes, madam, I did. With you gone, my days are dreadfully boring, so I decided to explore social media. I want you to have the honor of being my first friend—that is, if you wouldn't mind."

I blinked, caught off guard. Derran? Bored? Exploring social media? This was... unexpected. And yet, there was something oddly endearing about it.

'Of course," I said quickly, my tone sharper than I intended. Why did I always sound so cold? I cleared my throat, trying to soften my voice. 'I, uh... I've missed you. I appreciate all you've done."

The words felt awkward and forced, like I was pulling them out of some deep, neglected part of myself. I wasn't used to saying things like this—not to Derran, not to anyone. But it was true. I had missed him. More than I wanted to admit.

There was another pause, and for a moment, I wondered if I'd said something wrong. But then Derran spoke, his voice warm and gentle. 'Thank you, Lady Osyra. That means a great deal to me. I've missed you as well. The house feels... emptier without you."

I swallowed hard, my throat suddenly tight. The house felt emptier without me? That was... a lot. I didn't know how to respond.

'Yeah, well..." I trailed off, my voice trailing into silence. I didn't know what to say. I wasn't good at this—at being vulnerable, at admitting that I cared. But Derran had always been patient with me, even when I didn't deserve it.

'I'll accept the request," I said finally, my tone softer now. 'And, uh... if you need help figuring out Facebook or whatever, just let me know. I guess I owe you that much."

Derran chuckled, the sound low and soothing. 'I may take you up on that offer, my lady. Social media is... quite the labyrinth. But I'm sure I'll manage. After all, I have you as my guide."

I rolled my eyes, but there was no real annoyance behind it. 'Yeah, yeah. Don't get too excited. It's not that complicated."

'I'll keep that in mind," he said, his tone amused. 'Take care, Lady Osyra. And don't hesitate to reach out if you need anything."

'I will," I said, though we both knew I probably wouldn't. 'You too, Derran."

I hung up the phone and stared at the screen for a moment, my chest feeling strangely heavy. Derran had always been there, a constant presence in my life, and I'd never really appreciated him until now.

I opened Facebook and accepted his friend request, a small smile tugging at the corners of my mouth. Derran's profile was exactly what I expected—pristine, professional, and utterly devoid of the chaos that filled most people's feeds. His cover photo was a tasteful shot of the estate's gardens, and his profile picture was the same one I'd seen in the friend request.

I clicked on his profile, scrolling through the sparse timeline. There wasn't much there—just a few posts about the weather and a single photo of the library, captioned A quiet afternoon. It was so... Derran.

I hesitated for a moment, then typed out a message.

Me: Welcome to Facebook. Try not to get sucked into the drama.

His response came almost immediately.

Derran: Thank you, my lady. I shall do my best to navigate this new frontier with grace.

I chuckled, shaking my head. Leave it to Derran to turn joining Facebook into some kind of noble endeavor.

I set my phone down and leaned back in my chair, staring at the ceiling. Derran was on Facebook. I was texting Taylor about mitosis. And for the first time in a long time, I didn't feel quite so alone.

It wasn't much, but it was something. And for now, that was enough.
