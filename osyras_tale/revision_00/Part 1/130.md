# Chapter 30 - Chimera One

The debriefing room aboard the mercenary group's mobile command carrier, The Bastion, was cold and sterile. The air smelled of recycled oxygen and antiseptic. Osyra sat perfectly still in a reinforced metal chair, her hands resting on her knees. Across the table, Vanity stood at parade rest, her violet ocular sensors dimmed to a soft glow. The only sound was the low hum of the ship's systems and the quiet tapping of Commander Kael's fingers on the data-slate in front of him.

He finally looked up, his cybernetic eye whirring softly as it focused on Osyra. 'The data from Prosperity Gap is... illuminating, Dr. Renaya."

On the wall behind him, holographic footage played on a loop. Osyra moving through the mine with terrifying speed and power. Vanity's flawless, one-handed shots. The creatures falling. Then, a thermal overlay flickered into view. It showed a sudden, intense bloom of heat and biochemical activity erupting from Osyra's body just before the creatures froze—a visible representation of the Fugue.

'Your physical performance is unprecedented," Kael continued, his voice a low rumble. 'Strength, speed, endurance—all off the charts. You are, without question, the most effective close-quarters asset I have ever seen. Unit V-73's tactical analysis and combat efficiency are also optimal. As a team, your combat metrics are... acceptable."

He paused, letting the word acceptable hang in the air. It was not a compliment. It was a rating.

'However," he said, tapping the data-slate, 'this ‘Fugue State' presents a significant operational complication. It is an uncontrolled biological event. It cannot be weaponized reliably. More importantly, it is a potent distraction. It affects every biological entity in the vicinity, friendly or otherwise. We cannot have you inadvertently pacifying an entire squad in the middle of a firefight."

Osyra said nothing. She kept her face a neutral mask, but a cold knot tightened in her stomach. This was it. The flaw Elias had seen. The reason for her exile to the archives. They were going to discard her again.

'Therefore," Kael stated, his tone leaving no room for argument, 'you will be granted full membership in this unit. Your call sign is Chimera One. But you will operate under specific conditions. You will not be quartered on The Bastion or at our main compound. The risk to personnel is unacceptable."

He slid a data-slate across the table. It displayed the deed to a property—a small, isolated dwelling on several acres of wooded land in a remote northern territory. 'You will reside here. The organization will cover the costs as long as you are employed. Should that employment end, the financial burden becomes yours. Unit V-73 will be stationed with you to provide continuous tactical support and monitoring."

It was a gilded cage. A private exile. She was too useful to throw away, but too dangerous to keep close.

'Do you understand and accept these terms, Chimera One?"

Osyra's voice was low, even. 'I understand."

'Good. Dismissed."

As they turned to leave, Kael added one last thing. 'Vanity. Report to Systems for a full diagnostic and behavioral alignment check before deployment."

Vanity's head tilted. 'Acknowledged."

The diagnostics bay was a stark white room filled with humming servers and complex interface machinery. Vanity stood connected to the main terminal by a thick data-cable plugged into a port at the base of her neck. A technician monitored the scrolling data on a large screen.

'Core programming... stable. Tactical algorithms... optimal. Combat performance... exceptional. Behavioral alignment..." The technician frowned, scrolling back through the data. 'That's strange."

Kael, who had been observing from the doorway, stepped closer. 'Report."

'Sir, her behavioral alignment diagnostics are returning a ‘neutral' reading. It's not a pass or a fail. It's like her core directives are present but... dormant. Overridden by a secondary, unregistered priority set. I can't identify the source. It's unlike any code I've ever seen. It's almost... organic in its complexity."

Kael's brow furrowed. 'Can you purge it? Reset her to factory specs?"

The technician shook his head. 'I wouldn't recommend it, sir. The foreign code is too deeply integrated with her primary operating system. A hard reset could cause a catastrophic cascade failure. She's functional. More than functional. I'd just... log it as an anomaly."

Kael stared at the android, her violet eyes glowing placidly. 'Anomaly logged. Disconnect her. She has her assignment."

Two days later, a transport deposited them at the end of a long, gravel driveway that cut through a dense forest of pine and fir. The vehicle didn't wait, kicking up dust as it retreated, leaving them in profound silence.

The house was not what Osyra expected. It wasn't a modern safehouse. It was a classic, rustic cabin built from weathered cedar and local stone, with a steeply pitched roof to shed winter snow. A wide porch wrapped around the front, holding a simple wooden rocking chair. The windows were paned with real glass, and a fieldstone chimney promised actual wood fires. There were no visible security panels, no comms array, no energy shield emitters. It was low technology by design. Isolated. Unplugged.

Osyra stood on the porch, a single duffel bag at her feet, and listened to the wind sigh through the tall pines. She was alone. Again.

The front door, made of solid oak with an iron latch, swung inward. Vanity stood in the doorway, having already entered. "The residence is secure," she stated. "There are no surveillance devices. No network connectivity beyond a landline telephone. The heating is propane, the water from a well. The kitchen is equipped with a gas stove and icebox. There is a 98.2% probability of complete privacy here." She paused, her head tilting. "It is... rustic."

Osyra didn't turn around. 'Good." The simplicity was a relief. No humming servers. No blinking lights. Just silence.

She heard Vanity take a step closer, her internal systems the only hint of technology in the entire scene. 'The diagnostic on The Bastion was thorough. They discovered the anomaly in my programming."

Osyra finally turned, leaning against the rough-hewn porch rail. 'What anomaly?"

Vanity's eyes glowed steadily in the gathering twilight. 'I am not the property of the mercenary unit. I am stolen property. My registered owner is Layla Null. I was brought to the biology facility with her for a processor upgrade. She was to authorize the installation. She never did."

The name hit Osyra like a physical blow. A memory, long buried and thick with guilt, surfaced with painful clarity.

The biology facility's main lobby. The low hum of climate control and the faint smell of antiseptic. And there, sitting alone in the waiting area, was a girl. She couldn't have been more than sixteen. She had long, wavy hair the color of old rust and bright, intelligent blue eyes that were fixed on a data-slate, completely absorbed. She looked up as Osyra passed, a faint, curious smile on her face. She was Layla Null, here with her android to update its processor. Osyra, charmed by the girl's sharp mind and seeing an opportunity, had offered her a glimpse of real, cutting-edge science. A private tour of the restricted labs. The girl's eyes had lit up with excitement. She had followed willingly, eagerly. She had trusted completely.

The girl who had shown no reaction to the early serum test. The girl who had simply... vanished from the records afterward. The system update was never completed because the owner, Layla, was never available to authorize it. The facility, unable to return me to my owner, held me in storage. I was later acquired by the mercenary group during a raid. I am stolen property.

'Layla Null," Osyra whispered, the name a ghost on her lips.

'Yes," Vanity said. 'My core command, my primary and unalterable directive, is to find her. To protect her. All other functions are secondary. This is the anomaly they could not identify. This is why my alignment is ‘neutral.' My morality is not theirs. It is hers."

Vanity took another step forward, her gaze fixed on Osyra. The wind rustled the trees, a sound like a thousand whispering voices.
