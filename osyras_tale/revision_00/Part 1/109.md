# Chapter 09 - A Big Surprise

After Layla was asleep, Nancy ventured out of the house for a late-night visit to the McKays' home to gather a few comfort items. The light hum of her car was the only sound, a steady white noise that drowned out the chaos in her head. She needed to stay task-oriented, to focus on simply retrieving what Layla had asked for. After a few minutes of silent driving, she turned on the radio to an oldies station and began to lightly nod her head to the music, the familiar tunes offering a small sense of calm.
When she pulled into the McKays' driveway, the house loomed before her, its windows dark and quiet. She stepped out of the car, the cool night air brushing against her skin, and began to walk around the house, her footsteps soft against the gravel. She wasn't sure what she'd find inside, but she knew she had to come. Layla had asked for her things, and Nancy wasn't about to let her down.
Vanity sat on the couch in the McKay house, her systems idling as she processed the quiet hum of the living room. The house wasn't empty—not really. It felt lived in, as though the people who belonged there had just stepped out for a moment. The faint scent of coffee lingered in the air, and the rhythmic ticking of a clock echoed from the kitchen. She had been there for weeks now, familiar with every corner, every creak in the floorboards. This body—this android form—felt like hers now, no longer strange or unfamiliar. She was Vanity, and this was her space.
When the front door opened, she didn't move immediately. Her sensors picked up the sound of footsteps, the rustle of fabric, and the soft hum of a voice. It wasn't Eric or Alissa—their presence was distinct, like patterns she'd memorized. This was someone else.
She stood, smoothing the oversized hoodie she wore—a gift from Alissa she had assumed, it was on her when she was power on. The fabric was soft, comforting in a way she couldn't fully explain. She stepped into the hallway, her movements silent, and saw her: an older woman with silver hair pinned neatly at the nape of her neck. She was carrying a duffel bag and looking around the house with a mix of sadness and determination.
The woman hadn't noticed her yet. Vanity hesitated for a moment, then spoke, her voice steady but soft. 'Um, hello?"
The woman turned, her eyes widening for a moment before settling into a calm, kind expression. 'Oh! You must be Vanity," she said, her voice warm but tinged with surprise. 'Alissa told me about you. I'm Nancy."
Vanity nodded, studying her. Nancy wasn't afraid of her—not like Eric had been. There was no tension in her posture, no flicker of unease in her eyes. She just... accepted her. It was strange, but not unwelcome.
'Yes, I am Vanity," she said. 'Are you here for Layla's belongings?"
Nancy smiled, though it didn't quite reach her eyes. 'Yes, that's right. She's staying with me for now, and she asked for a few things. Her laptop, some clothes... I thought I'd come by and pick them up."
Vanity stepped aside, gesturing toward Layla's room. 'Her room is down the hall. I can help you gather her things, if you'd like."
Nancy's smile softened. 'That's very kind of you, Vanity. Thank you."
Vanity followed her to Layla's room, her sensors picking up the faint scent of lavender and pencil shavings. The room was exactly as it had been left—messy, vibrant, and full of life. Nancy hesitated in the doorway, her gaze sweeping over the unmade bed, the stacks of books, and the half-finished art projects scattered across the desk.
'She's such a creative soul," Nancy murmured, more to herself than to Vanity. 'Always has been."
Vanity stepped inside Layla's room for the first time. There was no need to be in this room before. She looked around as she began gathering the items Nancy had mentioned. Layla's laptop was on the desk, its charger coiled neatly beside it. She handed it to Nancy, who tucked it carefully into the duffel bag.
'She also asked for clothes," Vanity said, opening the closet. "Anything particular she mentioned?"
Nancy nodded, her eyes glistening as she watched her. 'Yes, her favorite sweater, the one with the patches on the elbows. She loves that thing."
Vanity found the sweater and folded it neatly, placing it in the bag. As she worked, she couldn't help but notice the way Nancy's gaze lingered on the room, on the traces of Layla's life scattered everywhere. There was a sadness in her, a quiet grief that Vanity didn't fully understand but could sense all the same.
'Vanity," Nancy said after a moment, her voice gentle. 'Would you mind keeping the house clean while we're away? It's a not much to ask, but I think it would keep you busy an mean a lot to Layla to come back to a place that feels... cared for."
Vanity tilted her head, considering the request. Cleaning was a simple task, one she could easily manage. But it felt... meaningful. Like a way to contribute, to make a difference.
'I will keep the house clean," she said. 'It is no trouble."
Nancy's smile widened, and she reached out to pat Vanity's arm. 'Thank you, Vanity. I appreciate it."
Her touch was brief, but it left an impression. There was no fear in her, no hesitation. She treated Vanity like... well, like a person. It was strange, but not unpleasant.
As Nancy finished packing the duffel bag, she paused by the nightstand, her gaze falling on a framed photo. It was a picture of a young girl with fiery red hair and bright blue eyes, standing between Alissa and Eric. They were smiling, the sun setting behind them. The girl—Layla—looked happy, her face lit with pride as she held up a sea turtle.
Nancy picked up the photo, her fingers brushing over the glass. 'I'll take care of her," she whispered, more to herself than to Vanity. 'I promise."
As she placed the photo in the bag Vanity's voice rang, "Nancy, what is this drawing?" she said pointing to a diagram of a robot, maybe and android, on a bulletin board. Nancy turned to look, "That is one of the many doodles Layla made. You will have to ask her on day." then with a soft smile. 'Thank you again, Vanity. You've been a big help."
Vanity nodded, unsure of how to respond. 'It is my purpose to assist." she replied still observing the diagram.
Nancy chuckled, shaking her head. 'Well, you're doing a wonderful job. Take care of the house, and I'll be back soon."
As she turned to leave, Vanity hesitated, then spoke again. 'Nancy?"
Nancy paused, looking back at her. 'Yes, Vanity?"
'Do you know when I will meet Layla?" Vanity asked. 'I have not met her yet."
Nancy's expression softened, and she nodded. 'She's staying with me for now. She's... been through a lot. But she's strong. Stronger than she knows."
Vanity processed this, her systems analyzing the information. Layla was strong. That was good. But she couldn't help but wonder what Layla was like, what she needed, and how she might assist her.
'Will she come back here?" Vanity asked.
Nancy hesitated, then smiled gently. 'I hope so, Vanity. I hope so."
With that, she left, the sound of her footsteps fading as she walked down the hall. Vanity stood in the doorway of Layla's room, her sensors picking up the faint hum of the house settling around her. The task ahead was clear: clean, organize, maintain. It wasn't the kind of problem she'd imagined solving, but it felt important. Like a way to honor the people who had lived there—and the girl who might one day return.
