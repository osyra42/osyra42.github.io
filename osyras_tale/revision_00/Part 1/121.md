# Chapter 21 - Clinical Trials

The approval came faster than expected—too fast, really, for any properly regulated institution.

<< PRIORITY RESPONSE: COUNCIL REVIEW COMPLETE >>
<< AUTHORIZATION GRANTED FOR LIVE-SUBJECT TESTING >>

I stared at the screen, the sterile glow reflecting off my glasses. Class D prisoners. Terminal sentences. A bureaucratic euphemism for expendable.

Elias and Lina hovered near the door, their silence louder than any protest. They knew better than to question it.

The Warden arrived within the hour, his boots echoing in the lab's antiseptic hallway. I hadn't expected him to deliver the subject personally.

"Dr. Renaya." He stepped aside, revealing a gaunt man in an orange jumpsuit flanked by two armored guards. The prisoner's wrists were already cuffed, his eyes darting between the syringes on my tray and the rifle barrels at his back.

"I have business elsewhere," the Warden said, as casually as announcing a lunch break. He nodded to the guards. "You stay. Protect the doctor."

Then he left—just like that—as if he'd delivered a package of lab mice instead of a living, breathing human.

The prisoner swallowed hard. "What's going on?"

I selected a syringe from the cooler, the serum inside swirling like liquid mercury. Lie protocol activated.

"Experimental treatment for muscular atrophy," I said, rolling my chair toward him. "You're lucky. This could change your life."

The man's shoulders relaxed. Idiot. Then he had the audacity to smirk. "You know, you're really pretty, miss."

I snapped the rubber tourniquet around his arm harder than necessary. "Clench your fist."

He obeyed. As I swabbed his vein with alcohol, I caught the guards shifting—their fingers tightening on their rifles.

The needle slid in cleanly.

Then—

A snarl. The prisoner's head jerked toward my wrist, teeth bared.

One of the guards slammed him back into the chair, helmet grating against my ear. "He's attempting to bite you, Doctor."

I drove the plunger down in one sharp motion. "Containment chamber. Now."

The guards hauled him up, chair and all. His screams started before they reached the door—not pain, not yet, but panic, the raw animal terror of a man realizing he'd been lied to.

Elias flinched. Lina's pen hovered over her clipboard.

I wiped my hands on a sanitizing cloth. "Well? We have work to do."

The observation window revealed our subject thrashing against his restraints, veins bulging black beneath his skin. Fascinating.

I pressed the intercom. "Subject is exhibiting Stage One physical augmentation. Note the pupillary dilation—excellent low-light adaptation already."

The prisoner's head snapped toward the sound of my voice. His pupils were slitted now. Feline. Perfect.

Behind me, Elias whispered, "God, his teeth—"

I didn't look away from the glass. "Document everything. This is what progress looks like."

Somewhere in the facility, alarms began to blare. An unrelated disturbance, no doubt.

I smiled.

Finally—finally—things were getting interesting.
