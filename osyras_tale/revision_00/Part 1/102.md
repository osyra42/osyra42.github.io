# Chapter 02 - The Gilded Cage

The tires of my car crunched over the immaculate gravel of the driveway, a sound that always felt like an announcement of my arrival to a house that wasn't listening. I pulled into my designated spot, and right on cue, Derran emerged from the side entrance. He was a silhouette of calm efficiency against the sprawling, opulent backdrop of the mansion—a well-groomed, unthreatening older man with smooth black skin, always dressed impeccably in his tailored suit. In his hands was the usual stack of updates, a physical manifestation of the life I was supposed to want.

'Congratulations, Lady Osyra," he said, his voice a practiced, polite baritone that never rose to meet my irritation. He held out an opened letter. 'You've been accepted into your first-choice college."

I unbuckled my seatbelt, my movements sharp with a frustration that felt too dramatic for the situation but was my only outlet. At seventeen, I was already a bit too tall, my frame feeling awkward and conspicuous. I rolled my eyes, feeling a flush of annoyance warm my light brown skin. 'Yeah, yeah, you just told me what it says. I don't need the paper. Thanks, Derran."

He nodded, his expression a mask of infinite patience. 'Of course, my lady. I'll leave it here for you, should you wish to review it later."

'Whatever," I muttered, brushing past him. My black hair fell into my face, a convenient curtain. 'I'm gonna be busy studying for finals today, and then I'm heading out to the club with some friends. If my parents suddenly remember I exist, just tell them I joined a cult or something."

Derran's lips twitched into that faint, enduring smile. 'Ah, your humor never fails to amuse me. Should they inquire, I shall relay your message... verbatim."

I didn't bother responding, pushing open a heavy side door into the cavernous silence of the estate. About a year and a half ago, I'd claimed a room in a far corner where my parents never ventured. It was my sanctuary from the gilded cage, the one place the performance of being the "privileged daughter" could be suspended.

I flopped into the chair at my desk, my brown eyes scanning the familiar walls. The room was large, but it felt lived-in, unlike the sterile perfection of the rest of the house. I turned on my computer, the hum of the top-of-the-line machine a comforting constant, and slipped on my headphones. Soft music filled my ears as I opened my study materials. This was my true escape. In the logical, predictable world of AP Biology, there were answers. Things made sense. It was the one domain I could completely control.

As I typed answers into the worksheet, a part of my mind, the part that always questioned, wondered why I didn't know more about the tech I used every day. I could diagram a cell in my sleep, but the silicon heart of my PC was a mystery. The thought was a fleeting itch, quickly buried under the more pressing need to excel.

Half an hour in, a Facebook notification popped up. A break was earned. I clicked on it.

It was a link to a video about genetically engineering cat girls. The presenter was spouting nonsense, using terminology so incorrect it was physically painful. My jaw tightened. _Why couldn't people just do their research?_ It was so easy. The effort required to be wrong seemed, to me, greater than the effort to be right.

I clicked back to see the sender. Taylor Mitts. Of course. An airhead, by all accounts. Popular, vapid, existing in a social stratosphere I had no interest in. I closed the app with a sigh, the simmering irritation now directed inward. Sometimes, it felt like my brain was the only thing of value I possessed. Everyone at school saw the unlimited money, the mansion, the car. They didn't see the empty texts from my parents, the way they only ever checked on me through Derran or the maid, Irina. They were ghosts in their own mansion, and I was the living trophy left on display, polished but ignored.

I was born healthy, whole, and brilliant—everything they could have wanted. And yet, the only acknowledgement I dreamed of was a glance, a question, a sign that they saw the person behind the potential. The silence was a constant, low-grade hum, louder than any music.

Derran's calm voice echoed in my head. He never judged, never pushed. He was the sole, steady presence. _He'd leave trays outside my door when I worked too late. A sandwich, milk. Sometimes a note: 'Don't forget to sleep, Miss Osyra.'_ The memory, borrowed from a future self, hit me with a sudden pang of guilt. I was too wrapped up in trying to earn my parents' attention to ever thank him properly. He was the one who cared, and I snapped at him because his kindness was a constant, painful reminder of what was missing everywhere else.

I shook my head, forcing the thought away. Finals were coming. I couldn't afford to slip up. Not now. Not ever.

A few hours later, the worksheet was submitted. A small, sterile wave of satisfaction washed over me. I leaned back, stretching my arms, my tall frame feeling stiff. The club wasn't until 9, so I ordered Chinese food, changed into a uniform of rebellion—a black crop top, high-waisted jeans, and a leather jacket—and devoured the lo mein in the solitude of my room.

When I came downstairs to leave, Derran was in the foyer, a silent sentinel.  
'Heading out, my lady?"  
'Yeah. I'll be back late. Don't wait up."  
'Of course. Do take care."  
I nodded, the words "Thanks, Derran" sticking in my throat, another thanks I couldn't properly give.

The club was a sensory assault. The bass vibrated up through the soles of my boots, and the air was thick with cheap body spray and the frantic energy of teenagers trying on adulthood for size. Neon lights pulsed, casting the writhing mass of bodies in garish colors. I scanned the crowd, my gaze passing over a sea of anonymous faces—jocks preening, popular girls shrieking with performative joy, wallflowers trying to disappear. They were set dressing, a blur of irrelevance. I had little interest in any of them, but I knew how to play the part, how to exchange the small talk that kept me from being a complete pariah.

I spotted my "friends" near the edge of the dance floor. The necessary acquaintances. I made my way over, offering a practiced, non-committal smile to their greetings. I engaged in the hollow ritual of conversation, nodding at inanities about music and mocktails, my mind a million miles away. I was just going through the motions, a ghost in a room full of the living.

But then my eyes caught a dissonant movement near the DJ booth. An older guy, his pupils blown wide and glassy from whatever he was on, was looming over the DJ, Yuki. She was the small Japanese girl with the defiant shock of blue and pink hair, now trying to mix the next track with a tense, frightened focus.

It happened fast. He laughed, a wet, ugly sound, and snagged his fingers in her colorful hair, yanking her head back. She let out a sharp gasp of pain, her hands flying up to his wrist.

"Come on, don't be like that," he slurred, his voice carrying over the thumping beat. In one brutish motion, he spun her around and got behind her, wrapping his forearm around her neck, pulling her back against his chest. She clawed at his arm, her feet scrambling for purchase on the platform. Then, his other hand came up and groped her breast, squeezing roughly through her top.

A cold, sharp clarity cut through the fog of my boredom and self-pity. The music, the chatter, the meaningless faces—it all faded into a dull roar. All I could see was the predator and his prey. The injustice of it was a spark on the tinder of my own pent-up rage.

I was moving before I had fully formed a thought. I shoved through a couple of dancers, my taller frame giving me an advantage.

"Get your hands off her!" I yelled, my voice cutting through the music with a force I didn't know I possessed.

The man's head snapped up. He looked me up and down, a leer twisting his features. Yuki was choking, her eyes wide with terror, fixed on me.

"And what are you gonna do about it, little girl?" he sneered, his grip tightening on Yuki. "You gonna call your daddy?"

My gaze swept the vicinity, cold and analytical. I wasn't panicking. I was problem-solving. My eyes landed on a high-top table where a game of pool had been abandoned. In the center of the green felt, sat the solid, off-white sphere of the cue ball.

_Perfect._

I didn't run. I walked over with a deliberate, terrifying calm, my boots clicking on the floor. I picked up the cue ball. It was heavy, cool, and perfectly balanced in my palm. The weight of it was a promise.

He watched me, his drugged brain slowly processing the threat. His leer faltered, replaced by a flicker of confusion. He started to say something, to push Yuki away, but it was too late.

I didn't swing wildly. I stepped forward, pivoted my hips for power, and drove the solid rock forward in a short, brutal arc aimed directly at the center of his face.

The impact was sickening. It wasn't a clean _crack_, but a wet, crushing _thud_ of cartilage and bone giving way. His head snapped back. A spray of blood and saliva misted the air. I felt the vibration of the impact travel up my arm.

He made a gurgling, animal sound as he released Yuki and stumbled back, his hands flying to his ruined face. Blood poured between his fingers, a dark, shocking crimson against the strobe lights. He collapsed to his knees, then onto his side, curling into a fetal position, moaning and spitting out fragments of teeth.

The music faltered as Yuki hit a switch. A stunned silence fell over our section of the club, broken only by the man's wet, choking whimpers and the thumping bass from the distant speakers.

I stood there, the cue ball still in my hand, now sticky with blood. I looked at Yuki. Her hand was at her throat, her chest heaving. She looked from the moaning man on the floor to me, her expression a mixture of sheer terror and overwhelming relief.

She gave me a shaky, almost imperceptible nod.

In the resulting silence, I finally heard the echo of my own future memory, a ghost from a life not yet lived.

_Picked up a cue ball and smashed his teeth in._

I dropped the cue ball. It hit the floor with a heavy, final _thud_ that seemed to shake the room.

For the first time all day, I wasn't the lonely rich girl, the studious overachiever, or the polite daughter. I was just a force of consequence. And as I looked at the graphic, uncomfortable reality of what I had done, I felt a terrible, satisfying calm. I had finally done something that couldn't be ignored.
