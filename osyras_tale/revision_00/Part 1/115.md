# Chapter 15 - The Warehouse

Over the past two years, Layla's life had undergone significant changes. When she turned 18, she inherited the properties of her parents' estate, a transfer formally signed off by her older sister, Nala, who had returned briefly to handle the legalities before resuming her missionary work abroad. The McKay family home, filled with memories of her parents, had been sold to settle outstanding taxes and debts, leaving Layla with a clean financial slate. Though the house was gone, Layla still lived with Nancy, who had become her steadfast guardian and confidante. Nancy had also welcomed Vanity into their home, recognizing the android's importance to Layla and her parents' legacy.

Vanity, now a constant presence in Layla's life, had evolved in ways that blurred the line between machine and human. Her advanced design allowed her to mimic human movements and responses with uncanny precision, and her violet eyes and calm demeanor made her seem almost alive. At night, when Vanity and Layla sat together, they looked like mother and child—though, at 4'11", Layla often appeared more like a teenager than an adult. Her petite stature was due to a non-life-threatening growth hormone deficiency, a fact documented in her medical records but rarely discussed. Despite her small frame, Layla carried herself with determination, determined to honor her parents' legacy.

The warehouse Layla inherited was one of the last remaining assets of her parents' once-thriving tech empire. According to the files, the facility was still operational, though barely. About 30 employees remained, producing home assistant androids—basic models that were functional but outdated compared to Vanity, who was decades ahead in terms of technology. Layla had never visited the warehouse before, but now, as its legal owner, she felt compelled to see it for herself. With Vanity by her side, she drove up to the facility, unsure of what to expect but ready to face whatever lay ahead.

Layla's smart car approached the gate of the warehouse, its tires crunching over gravel. The facility loomed in the distance, its massive structure weathered but still imposing. A key card reader stood at the entrance, and Layla swiped her card, her hands trembling slightly. The gate creaked open, and she drove forward, her heart pounding in her chest.

From a security tower above, a voice boomed over a megaphone. 'Stop!"

Layla slammed on the brakes, her car jerking to a halt. She glanced in the rearview mirror at Vanity, who sat calmly in the back seat, her violet eyes scanning the surroundings. 'They don't know me," Layla whispered, her voice tinged with nervousness. 'This might not go well."

Before Vanity could respond, a humvee roared into view, kicking up dust as it skidded to a stop. Five heavily armed guards spilled out, their weapons trained on Layla's car. The lead guard, a tall man with a scar running down his cheek, approached the driver's side, his expression stern.

'Step out of the vehicle!" he barked, his voice sharp and commanding.

Layla hesitated, her hands gripping the wheel. Vanity leaned forward, her voice calm but firm. 'Stay in the car, Layla. Let me handle this."

Vanity opened the door and stepped out, her movements smooth and deliberate. The guards immediately shifted their focus to her, their weapons still raised. 'Identify yourself!" the lead guard demanded.

'My name is Vanity," she replied, her tone steady. 'I am here with Layla McKay, the new owner of this facility. She has inherited this property and is here to assess its operations."

The guards exchanged glances, their expressions a mix of confusion and suspicion. The lead guard narrowed his eyes. 'Layla McKay? The kid in the car?"

Vanity nodded. 'Yes. Layla is the legal owner. If you require verification, we can provide documentation."

The guard hesitated, then gestured to one of his men. 'Check the car. Carefully."

One of the guards approached Layla's side of the vehicle, his weapon still trained on her. Layla rolled down the window, her hands visibly shaking. 'I-I have the paperwork," she stammered, reaching into the glove compartment and pulling out a folder. 'It's all here. My parents left this place to me."

The guard took the folder and flipped through it, his eyes scanning the documents. After a moment, he nodded to the leader. 'It's legit. She's the owner."

The lead guard lowered his weapon slightly, though his expression remained wary. 'Alright," he said, his tone less hostile but still cautious. 'But you can't just show up unannounced like this. We've got protocols."

Vanity stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. 'Understood. However, as the new owner, Layla has the right to inspect her property. We will comply with your protocols, but we expect to be treated with the respect due to the owner of this facility."

The guard studied Vanity for a moment, then nodded. 'Fine. Follow us. We'll take you to the main office. But keep your hands where we can see them."

Layla let out a shaky breath as Vanity returned to the car. 'Are you okay?" Vanity asked, her voice soft.

'Yeah," Layla whispered, though her hands were still trembling. 'I just... didn't expect this."

Vanity placed a reassuring hand on Layla's shoulder. 'It's going to be alright. I'm here with you."

The guards led them through the gates and into the facility, their humvee trailing closely behind Layla's car. The warehouse loomed ahead, its massive doors closed and its exterior weathered but intact. Layla couldn't help but feel a mix of awe and anxiety as they approached. This was hers now. Her parents' legacy. And she had no idea what she was walking into.

When they reached the main office, the guards directed them to park and escorted them inside. The interior was stark and utilitarian, with fluorescent lights buzzing overhead and a faint smell of oil and metal in the air. A man in a suit stood waiting for them, his expression a mix of curiosity and caution.

'Ms. McKay," he said, extending a hand. 'I'm Daniel Harris, the facility manager. We weren't expecting you."

Layla shook his hand, her grip weak but polite. 'I-I know. I'm sorry for the surprise. I just... wanted to see the place."

Daniel nodded, though his eyes flicked to Vanity, who stood silently beside Layla. 'And this is...?"

'Vanity," Layla said quickly. 'She's... my assistant."

Daniel raised an eyebrow but didn't press further. 'Well, welcome to the facility. Let me give you a tour."

As they walked through the warehouse, Layla's anxiety began to ease. The facility was massive, with rows of assembly lines and workers bustling about. The androids being produced here were sleek and modern, but they paled in comparison to Vanity. Layla couldn't help but feel a sense of pride as she watched Vanity move with such grace and precision, her advanced design a stark contrast to the simpler models being assembled.

'This is incredible," Layla murmured as they reached the control room, where a team of engineers monitored the production lines.

Daniel smiled, though there was a hint of sadness in his eyes. 'Your parents built something amazing here. It's been a struggle to keep it running, but we've managed."

But there was something else on her mind—something she hadn't mentioned to Daniel. 'Actually," she said, hesitating for a moment, 'I'm also looking for something specific. The blueprints for Vanity. Do you know if they're here?"

Daniel's expression shifted, a flicker of surprise crossing his face. 'Vanity's blueprints? That's... not something I've seen. But there is a small study room that's been locked for years. No one's been inside since your parents... well, since they passed. It might be worth checking."

Layla's heart skipped a beat. 'Can you show me?"

Daniel led her back into the facility, down a narrow hallway to a door marked Private. It was locked, the handle dusty from disuse. 'This is it," he said. 'But I don't have the key. No one does."

Layla frowned, her hope fading. But then Daniel paused, as if remembering something. 'Wait here," he said, turning on his heel and heading toward his office. A few minutes later, he returned holding a manila envelope. He handed it to Layla, his expression unreadable.

'Nala left this for you," he said. 'She said to give it to you if you ever came by."

Layla's hands trembled as she opened the envelope. Inside was a letter and a small, brass key. She unfolded the letter, her eyes scanning the familiar handwriting.

Layla,
If you're reading this, it means you've finally come to see the warehouse. I knew you would. There's something in the study room that belongs to you—something Mom and Dad wanted you to have. The key is inside this envelope. Be careful, and trust Vanity. She's more than she seems.
Love, Nala.

Layla's breath caught in her throat. She looked up at Daniel, then at Vanity, who stood silently beside her.

'This is it," she whispered, clutching the key. 'This is what I've been looking for."

Daniel stepped aside, gesturing toward the locked door. 'It's all yours, Ms. McKay."

Layla inserted the key into the lock, her hands shaking. The door creaked open, revealing a small, dimly lit room filled with shelves of old files, blueprints, and prototypes. Her eyes immediately landed on a set of rolled-up blueprints labeled Project Vanity.

Layla's eyes widened as the realization hit her. 'Vanity," she said slowly, her voice tinged with both excitement and unease, 'this chip... it's the one described in the missing pages of your manual. The one they never explained. The security chip."

Vanity's violet eyes flickered as she processed the information. 'That would explain the gap in the documentation," she said calmly. 'The chip appears to be a critical component, not only for my multitasking capabilities but also for operational integrity. Its absence would leave a significant vulnerability in my design."

Layla's mind raced as she stared at the document. 'But if you don't have the chip... how are you functioning at all? And why didn't Mom and Dad install it?"

Vanity tilted her head, her expression thoughtful. 'It's possible they were unable to acquire or manufacture the chip before their passing. Alternatively, they may have intentionally left it out, perhaps as a safeguard or due to ethical concerns."

Layla frowned, her fingers tracing the edges of the document. 'But if this chip is so important, why wouldn't they have told someone? Why leave it as a mystery?"

Vanity's gaze softened, her voice gentle. 'Your parents were meticulous, Layla. If they left this unresolved, it was likely for a reason. Perhaps they wanted you to find the answers yourself."

Layla's chest tightened at the mention of her parents. She looked down at the blueprint, her vision blurring slightly. 'Then we need to figure this out. If this chip is out there—if it was ever made—we have to find it. It's not just about understanding you, Vanity. It's about finishing what they started."

Vanity nodded, her movements smooth and deliberate. 'I will assist you in any way I can. However, we should proceed with caution. The chip's capabilities are advanced, and its absence suggests it may be... sensitive."

Layla glanced at the door, where the faint sound of footsteps still lingered. 'You're right. We don't know who else might be looking for this. Or why."

She carefully folded the document and slipped it back into the folder, tucking it under her arm. 'Let's get out of here. We'll take this back to Nancy's and figure out our next steps. But first..." She hesitated, then looked at Vanity. 'Do you think you can access the facility's records? See if there's any trace of this chip being delivered or manufactured?"

Vanity's eyes glowed faintly as she processed the request. 'I can attempt to interface with their systems, but it may trigger security protocols. If the guards outside are monitoring us, it could draw unwanted attention."

Layla bit her lip, weighing the risks. 'Do it. But be quick. If anyone asks, we're just... reviewing inventory or something."

Vanity nodded and stepped over to a terminal in the corner of the room. Her hand hovered over the keyboard for a moment before she began typing, her fingers moving faster than any human could. The screen flickered as lines of code scrolled by, and within seconds, Vanity's eyes narrowed slightly.

'There's no record of the chip being delivered," she said after a moment. 'However, there is a reference to a canceled order from a specialized manufacturer. It appears the chip was never produced."

Layla's heart sank. 'So it doesn't exist?"

Vanity shook her head. 'Not necessarily. The cancellation could mean the chip was deemed too risky or expensive to produce. Alternatively, it may have been manufactured elsewhere, off the books."

Layla clenched her fists, her determination hardening. 'Then we'll have to track it down. If it's out there, we'll find it."

Vanity turned to her, her violet eyes softly. 'I will help you, Layla. But we must be careful. This chip could change everything—not just for me, but for anyone who understands its potential."

Layla nodded, her resolve unwavering. 'I know. But this is what Mom and Dad would have wanted. They trusted us to figure this out. And I'm not going to let them down."

Vanity's lips curved into a faint, reassuring smile. 'Always, Layla. Always."

As they stepped out of the study room, a guard stood silently by the door, his expression unreadable. Layla's pulse quickened, but she kept her composure, clutching the folder tightly under her arm. She couldn't shake the feeling that they were on the edge of something monumental—something that could change everything. The missing chip, the unanswered questions, the cryptic clues left behind by her parents—it all felt like fragments of a puzzle she was only beginning to piece together. But with Vanity by her side, steady and unwavering, Layla felt a flicker of confidence.

Layla approached Daniel, who was waiting near the entrance of the facility. She handed him the folder, her expression serious but determined. 'I need you to look into this," she said, her voice steady. 'Find out where this chip is—or if it even exists. It's critical."

Daniel took the folder, his brow furrowing as he glanced at the contents. 'This is... unusual," he said slowly. 'But if it's important to you, I'll make it a priority. I'll reach out to our contacts and see what I can dig up."

Layla nodded, her gratitude evident despite the tension in her shoulders. 'Thank you, Daniel. Let me know as soon as you find anything."

With that, she turned and walked back to her car, Vanity following closely behind. The drive home was quiet, the hum of the engine filling the silence as Layla's mind raced. She replayed the day's events over and over, the weight of what they'd discovered pressing heavily on her. The missing chip, the cryptic notes, the guard's watchful presence—it all felt like pieces of a larger, more dangerous puzzle.

As they pulled into the driveway of Nancy's house, Layla let out a long breath, her hands still gripping the wheel. 'We'll figure this out," she said quietly, more to herself than to Vanity. 'We have to."

Vanity's violet eyes softly as she turned to Layla. 'We will," she said, her voice calm and reassuring. 'Together."

Layla nodded, her resolve hardening. Whatever challenges lay ahead, she was ready to face them—with Vanity by her side.
