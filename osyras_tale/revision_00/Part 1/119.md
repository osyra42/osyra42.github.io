# Chapter 19 - Happy Lab

Orientation  
The documents were clinical—beautifully, ruthlessly so. No wasted words, no moral hand-wringing, just  
crisp directives laid out like chemical formulae. Procedure 17-B: Containment Protocols. Section 4.3: Handling  
of Biological Anomalies. The language was sterile, efficient. No ethics committees, no limitations disguised as  
caution—just science, unburdened by the weight of opinion.  
I loved it.  
Dr. Miller briefed me on my objectives over black coffee that smelled faintly of formaldehyde. 'The Chimera  
Project," he said, sliding a file across the table. 'Human DNA spliced with animal traits—enhanced reflexes,  
night vision, heightened senses—while retaining full sentience. No degradation, no loss of higher function.  
Just... improvement."  
I flipped through the pages. Previous attempts had failed—predictably. Crude grafts, unstable  
hybridization, subjects reduced to drooling husks. Amateur work. My thesis had proposed a viral vector  
method, a far more elegant solution. And now, here I was, holding a badge that declared me Lead Researcher in  
bold, uncompromising letters.  
Dr. Osyra Renaya  
Clearance Level: 3  
Site 17 – Genetics Division  
The holographic emblem shimmered when I tilted the card—a sleek, stylized human silhouette with cat ears  
and whiskers. Cute. Almost mocking in its simplicity. This was my brand now. My team's insignia.  
Speaking of which—I was allowed two junior researchers. Assistants, really. The thought of sifting through  
personnel files for underqualified candidates was tedious, but necessary. I'd need someone meticulous for lab  
work, someone with steady hands and no inconvenient moral objections. And perhaps another with a talent for  
data analysis—someone who wouldn't question my methods, just execute.  
I tapped the tablet screen, pulling up the list of unassigned personnel. Names, credentials, psychological  
evaluations. Most were mediocre. A few showed promise.  
One stood out—Dr. Elias Voss, a biochemist with a penchant for unconventional solutions. His file noted a  
reprimand for bypassing safety protocols in a previous trial. Interesting.  
The second, Dr. Lina Cole, had a background in neurology and a dissertation on neural plasticity. Her notes  
described her as "highly adaptable."  
I smirked. Perfect.  
The facility hummed around me, a living thing of steel and ambition. No oversight. No restrictions. Just  
progress.  
Finally—finally—I had a lab of my own.  
The full orientation took about two weeks.  
Breakthrough  
Two weeks of isolation—though not truly alone. The cameras were always there, unblinking. The wandering  
eyes of security, the silent observers behind glass. But I didn't care. I was too absorbed in the work, in the  
possibility of it all.  
The lab was mine. The equipment, pristine and bleeding-edge, responded to my touch like an extension of  
my own mind. I didn't waste time exploring the facility, didn't bother with pointless socializing. Why would I? I  
had everything I needed right here.  
And then—finally—after months of meticulous adjustments, of watching samples degrade into useless  
sludge, of tweaking vectors and recalibrating sequences...  
Success.  
I pushed open the lab door that morning with the same measured detachment as always, expecting another  
day of minor adjustments, another log entry of failure. But the readout on the incubation chamber made me  
pause.  
Viable.  
Not just stable—active.  
I sat at the microscope, the soft glow of the monitor to my right casting pale light over my notes. The  
sample pulsed under the lens, a living lattice of human cells interlaced with foreign code. And then—  
Movement.  
The virus I'd introduced should have torn through the tissue, reducing it to necrotic waste. But instead...  
The cells fought back.  
Not rejection. Not destruction. Assimilation.  
My fingers flew over the keyboard, recording every shift, every microscopic rebellion. The human DNA  
wasn't just tolerating the viral invader—it was repurposing it. Rewriting the attack into a tool.  
A slow, razor-edged smile curled across my lips.  
Finally. Something interesting.  
I leaned in closer, the hum of the machinery around me fading into white noise.  
This wasn't just a sample.  
This was the beginning of something beautiful.  
I summoned my assistants the moment the discovery solidified in my mind—not out of necessity, but  
strategy. Let them believe they were witnessing something groundbreaking. Let them scribble notes like eager  
students.  
Elias arrived first, his sharp eyes flicking between the slides and my face, searching for approval. Lina  
followed, her fingers already twitching toward the keyboard, hungry for data.  
They had spent weeks on useless research—menial tasks, really. Documenting failed samples. Cataloging  
degradation rates. Busywork disguised as "training."  
I had designed it that way.  
Because today—today—they would finally witness something worthy of their notes.  
When I summoned them to the lab, they arrived with the eager obedience of junior researchers who had  
spent too long staring at dead-end data. Elias's fingers still smelled of sterilizer from his fruitless attempts at  
stabilizing previous samples. Lina's eyes were tired from squinting at screens full of meaningless genetic drift.  
Good. Let them be hungry.  
"Put your previous work aside," I said, not looking up from the microscope. "You're here to document  
something real this time."  
The way they rushed to their stations would have been pathetic if it wasn't so useful.  
For twelve uninterrupted hours, we worked. The microscope's recording function captured every moment  
as the hybrid cells did the impossible—not just surviving viral intrusion, but harnessing it. I watched my  
assistants' faces as comprehension dawned: Elias's sharp inhale when he noticed the DNA repair mechanisms  
activating; Lina's quiet "Oh" as she cross-referenced the mutation patterns with our database and found  
nothing comparable.  
"These readings—" Lina began.  
"—Are exactly what we've been working toward," I finished for her. "Now document them properly."  
They wrote like their careers depended on it. Perhaps they did.  
When we submitted the compiled research to the Council, I made sure to list them as co-authors. A  
calculated kindness—one that cost me nothing and bound them tighter to my work.  
The approval came faster than expected:  
<< PRIORITY RESPONSE: COUNCIL REVIEW COMPLETE >>  
<< AUTHORIZATION GRANTED FOR LIVE-SUBJECT TESTING >>  
<< SECURITY CLEARANCE UPGRADED TO LEVEL 4 >>  
I turned to my assistants, who were now staring at me with something between awe and fear.  
"Congratulations," I said, tapping the new clearance badge glowing on my tablet. "You've just graduated  
from theory to practice."  
Elias swallowed hard. Lina's fingers twitched toward the security protocols file already open on her screen.  
I smiled.  
Now the real work begins.
