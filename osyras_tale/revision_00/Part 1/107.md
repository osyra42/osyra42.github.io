# Chapter 07 - Who is impressed?

The lab was a sanctuary of sterile order. The only sounds were the hum of the refrigeration units and the precise click of my keyboard. Before me, electron microscope images glowed on the screen, revealing the elegant, terrifying architecture of a novel retrovirus. I was mapping its reverse transcriptase enzyme, noting a unique quirk in its proofreading mechanism that could explain its high mutation rate. This was a language I understood perfectly: the logic of pathology, the poetry of protein folding.

*This is it,* I thought, a familiar thrill cutting through my focus. *This is what matters.* Understanding something like this could lead to a new class of inhibitors. It was tangible, significant. Unlike the empty congratulations on a college acceptance.

A cold, familiar voice echoed in the back of my mind, the ghost of a future self. *They lived in a mansion on the hill. I was a trophy. The brilliant daughter for the society pages.*

I shoved the thought aside, my fingers tightening on the mouse. I zoomed in on the enzyme's active site. This was my proof. This was how I showed I was more than a trophy. Every published paper, every breakthrough, was a scream into the void of my parents' indifference: *See me. See what I can do.*

But tonight, the void was screaming back.

*It's the same.*

The thought was a cognitive parasite, hijacking my focus. I looked around the empty lab. The other students had left hours ago, off to study groups or parties—the messy, illogical business of human connection. I'd stayed, as always. The campus was bigger, the equipment more advanced, but the fundamental equation hadn't changed: Osyra alone with her work, trying to fill a silence that money and intellect couldn't touch.

*What's the point? Who is impressed?*

The questions were illogical, unscientific. They had no place here. Yet, they unspooled in my mind with devastating clarity. I was solving puzzles to impress ghosts. My parents wouldn't understand this research if I laid it out for them. Derran would be proud, but his pride had always been a given, unearned and therefore... weightless. The professors? They saw a sharp mind, a useful tool. Not a person.

I leaned back, the chair groaning in the silence. The virus on the screen was a masterpiece of efficient destruction. It knew its purpose. It didn't lie awake at night wondering if it was *enough*.

A tightness began to bloom behind my sternum, a physiological response to a psychological wound. *I am having a stress reaction,* I diagnosed coldly. *Increased heart rate, shallow respiration. The amygdala is hijacking the prefrontal cortex.* Knowing the terminology did nothing to stop it.

I stood up abruptly, my tall frame feeling unsteady. I needed to leave. The walk back to my dorm was a blur of flickering fluorescents and echoing footsteps. The thought was a mantra now, a recursive loop my brilliant mind couldn't break: *What if I am not enough?*

Back in my room, the walls felt like they were contracting. I stared at the single photo on my desk: me and Derran at graduation. His calm smile was an anchor, but it was miles away. The vice around my chest tightened. My breath hitched. This was a system failure. A cascade of every repressed moment of loneliness, every unacknowledged kindness.

Seeking a distraction, anything to short-circuit the panic, I grabbed my phone and opened Facebook. My feed was a blur of curated lives. And then, I saw them.

**Derran** had posted. A series of photos, each a quiet poem to a life I'd never known he had. A perfectly seared salmon fillet. A stunning sunset over a tranquil lake, his silhouette holding a fishing rod. It was so... wholesome. So separate from the world of the mansion. He had a full life, a peaceful one, that existed entirely outside of serving my family. The realization was a fresh pang of guilt. I'd never seen him as a person, only as a function.

Then, I saw **Uta Yuki**. Her profile was a burst of color and energy. She was still talking music, promoting local bands. But her statuses had changed.

**Uta Yuki:** Grand Re-Opening this weekend! The Bassment is now a fully-licensed mocktail bar & all-ages venue! No more creeps. Safe space, banging tunes. You know the vibe.

A mocktail bar for teens. A safe space. The words hit me with the force of a physical blow. My mind flashed back to the club, to the cue ball, to the man's bloody face. She had built a fortress against the very thing I'd fought against that night.

The need for connection, for someone who understood that specific part of my history, overrode my pride.

**Osyra:** Hey. Saw you opened a bar. That's amazing. Seriously.

**Uta Yuki:** Osyra? Holy shit. Yeah, the Bassment. It's mine now.

**Osyra:** No more handsy patrons, I hope.

**Uta Yuki:** lol. Not anymore. Got a zero-tolerance policy. And a little something behind the counter to enforce it.

A photo popped up. It was a picture of Uta, a confident smirk on her face, holding a sleek, black pistol. The caption she sent with it read: **Meet the new bouncer. .380 caliber. Says 'get the fuck out' a lot louder than I do.**

I stared at the image. The small, fierce girl I'd defended was gone. In her place was a woman who had taken her safety into her own hands.

**Osyra:** Looks like you don't need anyone to smash teeth in for you anymore.

The typing bubbles appeared and stayed for a long, tense moment.

**Uta Yuki:** I think about that night a lot. More than I should, probably. Everyone else just watched. They saw it happening and they looked away. But you... you *saw* me. And you didn't just get mad. You got... precise.

A cold shiver ran through me. *Precise.*

**Uta Yuki:** You assessed the problem, located the most efficient tool, and you neutralized the threat. It was the most terrifying and beautiful thing I've ever seen. That night, you taught me a lesson I've never forgotten: waiting for someone else to save you is a sucker's game. You taught me that my safety was my own responsibility. This... ***(Image Attached: the pistol)*** ...is because I learned from the best. You didn't just stand up for me, Osyra. You showed me how to stand up for myself.

Tears welled in my eyes, but they were different this time. Not of panic, but of a profound, staggering recognition. All this time, I had carried that memory as a secret, a testament to a feral part of myself I was supposed to be ashamed of. I had never once considered that for Uta, it wasn't a moment of shame, but one of empowerment.

I clicked on her profile, driven by a deep need to understand the person I had helped create. I scrolled through her photos. Her wall was a vibrant tapestry of a life being built. Pictures of her tearing out carpet, painting walls, wrestling with a keg. The evolution from "DJ Uta" to "Owner Yuki" was undeniable.

Then I found it. A post from three weeks ago.

**Uta Yuki:** Some guy tonight tried the "you don't belong here" crap. Told him this is my house. I built it. He left. No fuss, no muss. Didn't even have to raise my voice.

I could imagine. The ghost of the cowering DJ was gone. In her place was a proprietor, a defender of her own domain.

My thumb paused on another picture. Uta behind the new bar, smiling, holding up a complex, layered mocktail. The caption read: "The 'Shattered Cue Ball' - a new signature. Blue curaçao, lime, ginger beer, and a kick of cayenne. For those who like a little fire."

The name of the drink hit me in the chest. It was her way of owning it, of making it a part of her story without letting it define her as a victim. She had built a sanctuary, and she had named a drink after the weapon that helped make it possible.

The validation was no longer just in her words, but in the evidence of her life. My action wasn't a hidden stain; it was a cornerstone in someone else's foundation.

Just then, a stark, algorithmic interruption popped up at the top of my feed.

**People You May Know: Layla Null.**

The name was a void. A default gray silhouette. A non-person. A chill traced my spine. *Who?* But the echo of Uta's words—*You were like a force of nature*—formed a shield. The chill was distant, manageable.

I looked back at the chat window. The panic was gone. In its place was a quiet, solid calm.

**Osyra:** The 'Shattered Cue Ball'. I'd like to try one someday.

**Uta Yuki:** Anytime. First one's on the house. For life.

It wasn't a solution to my loneliness, my family, or the immense pressure I was under. But it was a thread, a real one, connecting me to a world outside the gilded cage and the sterile lab. It was a story we shared, and for the first time, I understood that my part in it wasn't something to be ashamed of.

It was, as she had said, beautiful.
