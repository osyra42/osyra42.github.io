# Chapter 16 - New Turbines

The African sun beat down mercilessly as Nala knelt in the red dirt, her calloused hands pressing another clay brick into place. Three years of missionary work had toughened her skin but softened her heart. Around her, the village buzzed with life - children chasing chickens between newly-built homes, women pounding cassava in rhythmic unison, old men nodding in the shade of the community center they'd built together. The scent of woodsmoke and simmering groundnut stew hung heavy in the afternoon air.

"Teacher Nala!" A chorus of small voices called out. She turned to see her youngest students approaching, their bare feet kicking up puffs of red dust. Little Kofi carried a wooden bowl carefully in both hands, his brow furrowed with concentration. "We brought your lunch!"

Nala wiped her brow with the back of her arm, leaving a streak of clay across her forehead. The rich aroma of peanut stew rose from the bowl, making her stomach growl. "You're early today," she chuckled, accepting the meal. The warmth seeped into her aching fingers. "Does Mama Amina know you took this?"

The children exchanged guilty glances before bursting into giggles. Nala shook her head with a smile - they'd have to bring Mama Amina extra firewood later to make up for their mischief.

As she ate, her students clustered around like eager chicks. Eight-year-old Ama proudly showed off the English letters she'd drawn in the dirt, while the twins argued over who could carry more water from the well. Their energy was contagious, and for a moment, Nala forgot the throbbing in her shoulders from lifting bricks all morning.

The peaceful moment shattered when Jacob, the mission leader, came striding across the compound, his usually calm face pinched with concern. The satellite phone in his hand looked absurdly out of place against the rustic backdrop of the village. "Nala!" he called. "It's your sister. From America."

The clay bowl nearly slipped from Nala's fingers. Layla? After all this time? The children fell silent, sensing the shift in mood as Nala stood abruptly, wiping her hands on her dusty skirt.

"Take over here," she murmured to Jacob, nodding at the half-built wall. Walking toward the shade of the ancient baobab tree, she noticed how her hands trembled - not from exhaustion now, but from the sudden flood of memories. The phone felt foreign in her rough, work-hardened palm.

She took a steadying breath before answering. "Layla?" Her voice came out rougher than she intended, thickened by dust and emotion.

The line crackled, then that familiar voice - higher pitched than she remembered, trembling slightly - "Nala? It's me. I... I need your help."

Nala's grip tightened on the phone. She could hear the wobble in her little sister's voice, the same one Layla used to get when she'd scraped her knee or had a nightmare. Without thinking, Nala fell into their old rhythm.

"I'm here," she said softly, the way she used to when comforting Layla after their parents' long work trips. Leaning against the half-built wind turbine frame, the sun-warmed metal pressed against her back. "What's wrong?"

"I found an invoice for a special chip," Layla explained, her words tumbling out in a nervous rush. "For the robots. The payment was canceled but I need to—"

"Wait," Nala interrupted gently, her missionary instincts kicking in. She absently rubbed a smudge of dirt from the turbine blade as she spoke. "Before you continue - have you checked the safety deposit box at First National? Dad always kept important contracts there. The key should be with his papers."

A pause on the line. Then Layla's voice, brighter now: "I...no, I didn't think of that."

Nala smiled, picturing her little sister's face lighting up with realization. She could almost see Layla biting her lip the way she always did when working through a problem. "And call Mr. Henderson at the bank - he handled all of Dad's business accounts. If there's money to cover this, he'll know where it is." A chuckle escaped her as a memory surfaced. "You remember Henderson, right? Big white mustache, always gave you lollipops when we went to the bank?"

A soft, genuine laugh came through the phone. "Yeah...yeah, I remember. He called them 'business expenses.'"

The sound of Layla's laughter sent a wave of nostalgia through Nala. She glanced at the village children playing nearby, their joyful shouts mixing with the whispering wind through the baobab leaves. "Start there," she said, her voice warm but firm. "And if you hit a wall, call me right away. I might be far away but I can still make some calls for you." She hesitated, then added, "Just...good luck with this, okay? Whatever it is."

"I will," Layla promised, sounding more confident now. "Thanks, Nala."

As the call ended, Nala handed the phone back to Jacob, her thoughts lingering on her sister. The village noises slowly filtered back into her awareness - the rhythmic thud of mortar and pestle, the bleating of goats, the distant chatter of women at the well. She turned back to the turbine, running her fingers along its smooth metal surface. The work here wasn't done yet - these people still needed her. But as she watched the children resume their play, their laughter carrying on the warm breeze, Nala realized with sudden clarity that for the first time in years, the pull of home felt just as strong as her calling here.
