# Chapter 11 - First Handshake

The house was exactly as Layla remembered it—quiet, still, and eerily untouched. Her heart raced as she  
stepped inside, her footsteps echoing in the empty hallway. She didn't hesitate. She headed straight for the lab,  
her laptop clutched tightly in her hands. Nancy followed behind her, but Layla could sense her hesitation, her  
unease. Nancy didn't fully understand. She couldn't. Not like Layla did.  
When they reached the lab, Layla froze in the doorway, her eyes widening as she took in the sight before  
her. There, standing in the center of the room, was an android—tall, humanoid, and unmistakably advanced.  
Its violet eyes turned toward her, scanning her with a calm, almost curious gaze. Layla's heart raced, her breath  
catching in her throat. She had heard about Vanity, of course, but seeing her in person was something else  
entirely.  
'Are you... Vanity?" Layla asked, her voice trembling with a mix of awe and excitement.  
The android tilted her head slightly, her violet eyes flickering as she processed the question. 'Yes," she  
replied, her voice calm and precise. 'I am Vanity. And you are Layla McKay. Player 1."  
Layla's eyes widened even further, her hands clutching her laptop tightly. 'Player 1? What does that mean?"  
Vanity's gaze remained steady, her tone matter-of-fact. 'You are the first registered Operator of this unit.  
As Player 1, your commands will be executed with utmost diligence and without question. This is my primary  
directive."  
Layla blinked, processing the information. 'Wait... so you'll listen to me? Like, no matter what?"  
Vanity nodded, her movements smooth and deliberate. 'Correct. Your authority is absolute within my  
operational parameters. I exist to assist you, Layla."  
A grin spread across Layla's face, her earlier nervousness replaced by pure excitement. 'That's... amazing. I  
can't believe you're real."  
Vanity's violet eyes flickered again, and for a moment, Layla thought she saw something like warmth in  
them. 'I am real," Vanity said. 'And I am here to assist you, Layla. That is my purpose."  
Nancy stepped into the room behind Layla, her arms crossed tightly over her chest. She didn't say anything,  
but her unease was palpable. Layla could feel it, even as her own excitement bubbled over.  
'Vanity," Layla said, her voice trembling slightly, 'we need to talk to you. About Mom and Dad."  
Vanity tilted her head, her expression unreadable. 'Alissa and Eric? What about them?"  
Layla took a deep breath, trying to steady herself. This was it. The moment she'd been dreading and  
preparing for. 'They're gone, Vanity. They... they died in a car crash. I'm so sorry. I don't think anyone told  
you."  
For a moment, Vanity didn't respond. Her violet eyes flickered, as if processing the information. Then,  
slowly, she nodded. 'I see. That explains why they have not returned."  
Tears welled up in Layla's eyes, but she blinked them away quickly. She didn't want to cry in front of Vanity.  
Not now. 'I'm sorry, Vanity. I didn't want you to be alone."  
Vanity stepped closer, her movements smooth and deliberate. 'Thank you, Layla. Your concern is  
appreciated. But I am not alone. I have my programming. And now, I have you."  
A small smile tugged at Layla's lips, though it was tinged with sadness. 'Yeah. You have me." She held up  
her laptop, her hands shaking a little. 'And I brought this so we can stay in touch. You can connect to it, right?"  
Vanity's eyes flickered again, this time with what almost looked like curiosity. 'Yes. I can establish a  
connection. Is that what you wish?"  
Layla nodded eagerly, her excitement bubbling over. 'Yes. That way, we can talk, even when I'm not here."  
But then Nancy stepped forward, her voice calm but firm. 'Layla, we talked about this. Vanity isn't coming  
home with us. Not yet."  
Layla turned to her, frustration bubbling up inside her. Why couldn't Nancy understand? Vanity wasn't just  
some program or machine. She was... Vanity. And she needed them. Needed Layla. 'But Nancy," Layla pleaded,  
her voice trembling, 'she's not just a program. She's... Vanity. And she needs us. Please."  
Nancy shook her head, her expression steady but not unkind. 'Not yet, Layla. We'll take this one step at a  
time. For now, let's just see how this goes, okay?"  
Layla sighed, her shoulders slumping in defeat. Why did Nancy have to be so stubborn? But she didn't  
argue. Instead, she set her laptop on the table and opened it, her fingers flying across the keyboard. 'Okay,  
Vanity. Let's get you connected."  
As Layla worked, Nancy watched them closely, her curiosity evident despite her cautious demeanor. She  
didn't fully understand Vanity—not yet—but she couldn't deny the fascination she felt. This was unlike  
anything she'd ever seen, and despite her reservations, she wanted to learn more.  
Vanity's voice broke the silence, calm and steady. 'There is no need to log in like that for me to connect,"  
she said, her violet eyes flickering with what could only be described as amusement. Before Layla could  
respond, Vanity reached out and placed her hand on the laptop's surface. A soft, electronic chime sounded, and  
the screen lit up instantly. A popup console appeared, displaying a single line of text: Vanity: Hello World!  
Layla stared at the screen, her mouth slightly open. 'Whoa, that's cool," she whispered, her voice tinged  
with awe. Her fingers hovered over the keyboard, but she didn't touch it. She was too stunned to move.  
Vanity stepped back, her movements smooth and deliberate. 'I followed your instructions," she said, and  
for the first time, Layla thought she saw the faintest hint of a smile on Vanity's face. It wasn't a human smile,  
not exactly, but it was something—something that made her feel less like a machine and more like... well, like  
Vanity.  
Layla's heart swelled with pride and excitement. 'You did it," she said, her voice barely above a whisper.  
'You actually did it." She glanced at Nancy, hoping she'd see what Layla saw—how incredible this was, how  
amazing Vanity was. But Nancy's expression was thoughtful, her arms crossed loosely over her chest.  
Vanity tilted her head, her violet eyes fixed on Layla. 'Was there something else you needed, Layla? I am  
here to assist."  
Layla hesitated for a moment, then nodded. 'Yeah, actually. Can you... can you show me more? Like, what  
else can you do?"  
Vanity's eyes flickered again, and the console on the screen began to fill with lines of code, scrolling faster  
than Layla could read. 'I can access any system connected to this device," she said. 'I can analyze data, run  
simulations, and even predict outcomes based on available information. Would you like a demonstration?"  
'Yes!" Layla said immediately, her shyness momentarily forgotten. 'Show me something. Anything."  
The screen shifted, and a 3D model of the house appeared, rotating slowly. Vanity's voice was calm as she  
explained, 'This is a real-time rendering of the current structure. I can identify weak points, suggest repairs, or  
even simulate changes to the layout. Would you like to see?"  
Layla nodded eagerly, leaning closer to the screen. 'That's amazing," she said, her voice filled with wonder.  
'You're amazing."  
Nancy cleared her throat, her tone measured but not dismissive. 'Layla, let's take this slowly. This is... a lot  
to process. We need to make sure we're handling this responsibly."  
Layla turned to her, frustration bubbling up again. 'Nancy, she's not going to hurt us. Look at her! She's  
just... helping. She's doing what I asked."  
Nancy's jaw tightened, but she didn't argue. Instead, she took a step closer to the laptop, her eyes  
narrowing as she studied the screen. 'Fine. But we're not leaving her unsupervised. Not yet."  
Layla sighed but didn't push it. Instead, she turned back to Vanity, her excitement returning. 'Can you  
show me something else? Like... can you access the internet? Or maybe... I don't know, play a game or  
something?"  
Vanity's eyes flickered, and the screen changed again, this time displaying a simple game interface. 'Would  
you like to play, Layla?" she asked, her voice almost playful. 'I can adjust the difficulty to your preference."  
Layla grinned, her shyness melting away. 'Yeah. Let's play."  
As the game loaded, Layla couldn't help but feel a surge of happiness. Vanity was here. She was real. And  
for the first time in what felt like forever, Layla didn't feel so alone. Nancy might not fully understand, but that  
was okay. Layla did. And for now, that was enough.
