# Chapter 07 – Who is Impressed?

The lab was sterile, cold, and quiet—exactly how I liked it. The hum of the overhead fluorescent lights was
the only sound, a steady white noise that drowned out the chaos in my head. I adjusted the microscope, my
fingers tightening on the knobs as I focused on the slide. The sample was a new strain of virus, one I’d been
assigned to analyze for my microbiology seminar. It was fascinating, really. The way something so small could
wreak so much havoc. It made sense to me in a way people never did.
I scribbled notes in the margins of my lab notebook, my handwriting sharp and precise. The virus had a
unique protein structure, one that could potentially make it more infectious. I was already running through the
implications in my head, the possibilities for mutation, the potential for a vaccine. This was what I lived for—
the puzzle, the challenge, the chance to prove I was the best.
But even as I worked, a nagging thought crept in.
It’s the same.
The thought was like a virus itself, infecting my focus. I tried to shake it off, to bury it under the weight of
my work, but it lingered.
It had been months since I’d started at the university, and nothing had changed. Sure, the campus was
bigger, the labs more advanced, and the professors more intimidating, but the feeling was the same. I was still
the girl who buried herself in her work, who stayed late in the lab while everyone else went out to parties or
study groups. I was still the girl who didn’t fit in.
I leaned back in my chair, staring at the microscope. The slide was still in focus, the virus still there, waiting
to be understood. But for the first time, I felt a flicker of doubt.
What’s the point?
The thought startled me. I’d never questioned it before. The point was to be the best, to prove I was worth
something, to show everyone—my parents, my teachers, myself—that I could do it. But now, sitting alone in the
lab, the doubt gnawed at me.
What if it’s not enough?
I shook my head, forcing the thought away. It was ridiculous. Of course it was enough. I was here, at the top
university, studying something I loved. I was where I was supposed to be.
But the doubt didn’t go away.
I glanced at the clock on the wall. It was late, almost midnight. The lab was empty, the other students long
gone. I should have left hours ago, but I couldn’t bring myself to. The thought of going back to my dorm, to the
silence and the emptiness, was unbearable.
I stood up, stretching my stiff muscles. My lab coat hung loosely on my frame, the fabric scratchy against
my skin. I grabbed my bag and slung it over my shoulder, the weight of it grounding me.
As I walked through the empty halls, the doubt followed me.
What if I’m not enough?
I pushed open the door to the stairwell, the sound of my footsteps echoing in the silence. The stairs were
dimly lit, the fluorescent lights flickering overhead. I took them two at a time, my pace quickening as if I could
outrun the thought.
But it was still there, waiting for me when I reached the bottom.
I stepped out into the cool night air, the campus quiet and still. The stars were hidden behind a layer of
clouds, the sky a dull gray. I took a deep breath, the air sharp in my lungs.
What if I’m not enough?
I shook my head, trying to clear it. I didn’t have time for this. I had work to do, a future to build. I couldn’t
afford to doubt myself.
But as I walked back to my dorm, the thought stayed with me, a shadow I couldn’t shake.
When I reached my room, I dropped my bag by the door and flopped onto the bed. The room was small,
barely big enough for the twin bed and desk. The walls were bare, the only decoration a single photo of me and
Derran from my high school graduation. He’d insisted on taking it, his calm smile a stark contrast to my forced
one.
I stared at the photo, the doubt creeping in again.
What if I’m not enough?
I closed my eyes, trying to block it out. But it was no use. The thought was there, loud and insistent.
I sat up, grabbing my laptop from the desk. If I couldn’t sleep, I might as well work. I opened a new
document, my fingers flying over the keys as I started typing up my notes from the lab.
The work was familiar, comforting. It was something I could control, something I could excel at. But even
as I typed, the doubt lingered.
What if it’s not enough?
I didn’t have an answer.
And for the first time, that scared me.
The room felt smaller than usual, the walls pressing in on me as I sat on the edge of my bed. My laptop was
open in front of me, the screen glowing faintly in the dark. My notes from the lab were still up, the words
blurring together as my vision swam. I couldn’t focus. My chest felt tight, like a vice was squeezing the air out of
me.
How can I not be enough?
The thought echoed in my head, louder and louder, until it was all I could hear. I was valedictorian. I was
the best. I got into my top university. I was supposed to be unstoppable. So why did I feel like I was crumbling?
I tried to breathe, but my lungs wouldn’t cooperate. Each breath came in shallow gasps, my heart pounding
in my ears. My hands trembled as I clutched the edge of the bed, my knuckles turning white.
Am I okay?
The question terrified me. I didn’t know the answer. I didn’t know anything anymore. The control I’d
always relied on, the control I’d built my entire life around, was slipping through my fingers.
I felt weak. Pathetic. I hated it.
I slumped back onto the bed, my body heavy and uncooperative. The tears came without warning, hot and
silent as they streamed down my face. I didn’t even have the energy to sob. I just lay there, staring at the
ceiling, feeling the weight of everything I’d been carrying crush me.
When was the last time I talked to someone?
The thought hit me like a punch to the gut. I couldn’t remember. Not really. There were the obligatory
greetings in class, the brief exchanges with lab partners, but nothing real. Nothing that mattered.
I missed Derran. I missed his calm voice, his gentle nagging, the way he always seemed to know when I
needed someone, even when I didn’t want to admit it. He was the only one who ever really cared, and now he
was miles away, in that stupid mansion with my parents who couldn’t even be bothered to text me.
I felt so alone.
My phone was on the nightstand, just out of reach. I stared at it, the screen dark and silent. I should reach
out. I should message someone, anyone. But who? My friends from high school? They were probably busy with
their own lives, their own problems. They didn’t need me dragging them down.
But I couldn’t do this alone. Not anymore.
I forced myself to sit up, my body trembling as I reached for the phone. My fingers fumbled as I unlocked it,
the brightness of the screen making my eyes water. I opened Facebook, my thumb hovering over the keyboard.
What do I even say?
I didn’t know. I didn’t know how to ask for help, how to admit that I wasn’t okay. I’d spent so long
pretending that I didn’t need anyone, that I was fine on my own. But I wasn’t fine. I wasn’t fine at all.
I typed out a message, my hands shaking so badly I could barely hit the right keys.
“Hey… is anyone awake?”
I stared at the words, my throat tight. It was stupid. It was weak. But I sent it anyway, because I didn’t know
what else to do.
I waited, my heart pounding as I stared at the screen. The seconds felt like hours, the silence pressing down
on me.
And then, a notification.
Taylor Mitts: OMG Osyra!! It’s been forever!! What’s up??
I blinked at the screen, the tears still streaming down my face. Taylor. Of all people, Taylor. The girl who
never took anything seriously, who lived in her own little world of sparkles and drama. But she’d responded.
She was there.
I didn’t know what to say. How do you explain to someone that you’re falling apart? That you’re not the
perfect, untouchable person they think you are?
I typed slowly, my fingers trembling.
“I don’t know. I just… needed to talk to someone.”
The response came almost immediately.
Taylor Mitts: Aww babe, of course!! You know I’m always here for you!! What’s going on??
I stared at the message, the kindness in it making my chest ache. I didn’t deserve it. I’d never been kind to
Taylor, not really. I’d always rolled my eyes at her, dismissed her as shallow and self-absorbed. But here she
was, reaching out when I needed someone.
I didn’t know how to respond. I didn’t know how to tell her that I was drowning, that I didn’t know how to
keep going. So I just typed the only thing I could think of.
“I think I’m having a panic attack.”
The words felt foreign, like they belonged to someone else. I’d never admitted it before, not even to myself.
But there it was, out in the open.
Taylor’s response was immediate.
Taylor Mitts: Oh no!! That’s the worst!! Do you want me to call you??
I hesitated, my thumb hovering over the screen. Did I want her to call? Did I want to hear her voice, to have
her try to comfort me? I didn’t know. But I didn’t want to be alone anymore.
“Yeah. Please.”
My phone rang a moment later, Taylor’s name flashing on the screen. I answered, my voice barely above a
whisper.
“Hey.”
“Osyra!!” Taylor’s voice was bright and cheerful, like a lifeline in the darkness. “Okay, first of all, you’re
gonna be fine. Panic attacks suck, but they’re not forever. Just breathe, okay? In and out. You got this.”
I tried to follow her instructions, my breaths shaky and uneven.
“I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” I admitted, my voice breaking. “I’m supposed to be the best. I’m
supposed to have it all together. But I don’t. I don’t know what I’m doing anymore.”
“Oh, honey,” Taylor said, her tone softening. “Nobody has it all together. Not really. We’re all just faking it
until we figure it out. And you’re, like, the smartest person I know. If anyone can figure it out, it’s you.”
I didn’t know what to say to that. I didn’t feel smart. I didn’t feel like I could figure anything out. But
Taylor’s words, as simple as they were, helped. Just a little.
We talked for what felt like hours, Taylor rambling about everything and nothing, her voice a steady anchor
in the storm. And for the first time in a long time, I didn’t feel so alone.
When we finally hung up, the room felt a little less suffocating. The panic had subsided, leaving me
exhausted but calmer. I lay back on the bed, staring at the ceiling, the tears drying on my face.
I wasn’t okay. Not yet. But maybe, just maybe, I would be.
