# Chapter 05 – A Second Tragedy

In the car, Alice sat in the passenger seat, staring out the windshield. The silence between her and Eric was
heavy, broken only by the hum of the engine. Finally, she spoke, her voice soft but probing. 'So, do you not
trust me?"
Eric kept his eyes on the road, his grip tightening on the steering wheel. 'It's not you I don't trust. It's that
machine. I helped draw the blueprints for it. I know what it's capable of."
Alice turned to him, her brow furrowed. 'So, what part makes you scared of it?"
Eric merged onto the highway, his jaw tightening. 'It's supposed to be capable of anything it decides to do.
According to you, you never programmed it to have an alignment like the other androids in the prototype.
What stops it from attacking people?"
'I trained it to solve problems," Alice countered, her voice firm. 'It wants to solve them."
'What if we are the problem?" Eric interrupted, his tone sharp.
Alice sighed, her patience wearing thin. 'The only people it will consider are those on the Player list. Other
people are basically invisible to it. It's required to take instructions from the Player list only."
Eric glanced at her, his expression tense. 'Look, I want to know there's a way to disable this thing if it goes
rogue."
Alice met his gaze, her eyes steady. 'I wanted this android to be superior to the rest of the androids before
they even hit the market. I tripled the reinforcement training. I made sure it would stay within the bounds of
the—"
Her words were cut off by the blaring horn of a utility vehicle barreling toward them on the wrong side of
the road. Eric slammed on the brakes, and Alice screamed. The dump truck in front of them swerved to avoid
the car, but the maneuver caused the truck to flip, crashing down onto their vehicle with a deafening crunch.
'Eric..." Alice whispered, her voice barely audible. She reached for him, her hand trembling, but the pain
was too much. Her vision blurred, and the world faded to black.
Three Days Later
The hospital room was sterile and quiet, the only sound the steady beep of the heart monitor. Alissa lay in
the bed, her face pale and drawn, her body connected to a web of tubes and wires. The accident had left her
with severe internal injuries, and despite the doctors' best efforts, she was fading fast.
Nancy Mitts sat by her bedside, her hands clasped tightly in her lap. Her kind eyes were filled with tears,
though she tried to keep her expression calm for Alissa's sake. She had always been a pillar of strength for the
McKay family, but this—this was too much.
'Alissa," Nancy said softly, reaching out to take her hand. 'I'm here. You're not alone."
Alissa's eyes fluttered open, and she turned her head slightly to look at Nancy. Her lips curved into a weak
smile, though it was clear even that small movement took effort. 'Nancy..." she whispered, her voice barely
above a whisper. 'Thank you... for being here."
Nancy squeezed her hand gently, her voice trembling. 'Of course, dear. I wouldn't be anywhere else."
Alissa's gaze drifted to the ceiling, her breathing shallow and labored. 'Layla..." she said, her voice breaking.
'Is she...?"
'She's safe," Nancy assured her quickly. 'She's staying with me for now. She's... she's holding up as best as
she can."
Alissa's eyes filled with tears, and she nodded weakly. 'Good... that's good. Nancy, I need you to promise
me something."
'Anything," Nancy said, leaning closer.
'Take care of her," Alissa said, her voice barely audible. 'She's been through so much already. She's lost so
much. I can't... I can't let her be alone again."
Nancy's heart ached at the plea. 'I will, Alissa. I promise. She'll always have a home with me."
Alissa's hand tightened weakly around Nancy's. 'And Nala... she's out there, somewhere. On her mission.
She doesn't know... about any of this."
Nancy nodded, though her stomach churned at the thought. Nala McKay, Alissa and Eric's biological
daughter, had left years ago to join a Christian missionary group. She'd been traveling the world, helping
communities in need, but her connection to the family had grown strained over time. Nancy hadn't seen her in
years.
'I'll find her," Nancy said, though the task felt daunting. 'I'll make sure she knows what's happened. She'll
come back for Layla. She has to."
Alissa's eyes closed, and a single tear slipped down her cheek. 'Nala... she's strong. Stronger than she
knows. But she's... she's been running from so much. I just hope... she can be what Layla needs."
Nancy brushed the tear away, her own vision blurring. 'She will be, Alissa. I'll make sure of it."
There was a long silence, broken only by the rhythmic beeping of the heart monitor. Nancy hesitated, then
spoke again, her voice soft but steady. 'Alissa... would it be alright if I prayed with you?"
Alissa's eyes fluttered open again, and for a moment, she simply looked at Nancy. Then, slowly, she nodded.
'Yes," she whispered. 'Please."
Nancy bowed her head, still holding Alissa's hand. Her voice was quiet but filled with conviction as she
began to pray. 'Heavenly Father, we come to You in this moment of sorrow and uncertainty. We ask for Your
comfort, Your peace, and Your strength. Be with Alissa now, Lord, as she prepares to come home to You. Wrap
her in Your love and let her know that she is not alone. And be with Layla, Father. Protect her, guide her, and
surround her with people who will love and care for her. We trust in Your plan, even when we cannot
understand it. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen."
When Nancy looked up, she saw that Alissa's eyes were closed again, but her expression was peaceful. Her
breathing had grown even shallower, and the beeping of the heart monitor began to slow.
'Thank you, Nancy," Alissa whispered, her voice barely audible. 'Tell Layla... I love her. Tell her I'm so
proud of her. And tell her... she's not alone. She'll never be alone."
Nancy nodded, though she could barely speak through her tears. 'I'll tell her, Alissa. I promise."
Alissa's hand went limp in Nancy's, and the heart monitor's steady beeping slowed, then flatlined. Nancy
sat there for a long moment, clutching Alissa's hand as the reality of what had happened settled over her. Alissa
was gone. Eric was gone. And Layla... Layla was orphaned again.
Later That Night
Nancy sat on the porch of her home, a cup of tea cooling in her hands. The night was quiet, the stars shining
brightly overhead, but her mind was anything but calm. She had just gotten Layla to sleep after hours of
comforting her, but the weight of the day still pressed heavily on her shoulders.
She thought about Alissa's final words, about Nala. Finding her wouldn't be easy. Nala had always been
independent, even as a child, and her decision to join the missionary group had been as much about finding
herself as it was about helping others. But Alissa was right—Nala was strong. And if anyone could step up for
Layla, it was her.
Nancy pulled out her phone and scrolled through her contacts until she found Nala's number. It had been
months since they'd last spoken, and even then, it had been a brief, awkward conversation. But this was too
important to wait.
She took a deep breath and dialed the number. The phone rang once, twice, then clicked as the call
connected.
'Hello?" Nala's voice was familiar, though it carried a weariness that hadn't been there before.
'Nala," Nancy said, her voice trembling. 'It's Nancy. I... I need to talk to you. It's about your parents."
There was a long pause on the other end of the line, and when Nala finally spoke, her voice was barely
above a whisper. 'What happened?"
