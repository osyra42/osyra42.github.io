# Chapter 22 – The First Chimeran

The subject from Trial 7-Cat3 twitched on the examination table, his breath shallow, his veins dark beneath his pallid skin. His pupils—still slit like a cat's—dilated weakly under the overhead lights. A month. That was longer than any of the others had lasted. And yet, here he was, decaying from the inside out, the spliced DNA unraveling him strand by strand.  
I pressed two fingers to his neck, feeling the erratic pulse. Too slow. Too weak.  
"Time of death," I said, withdrawing my hand, "14:37."  
Elias scribbled the note without looking up. Lina, ever the pragmatist, was already preparing the body for disposal. No fanfare. No eulogy. Just another data point in a long line of failures.  
I turned away from the corpse, my reflection glaring back at me from the observation window. Dark circles under my eyes, hair pulled into a haphazard knot, lab coat smudged with ink and antiseptic. I looked exhausted. I was exhausted.  
But I was also closer than ever.  
The first subject had died within hours. The second batch had lasted a day. Now, a full week was the average, with outliers pushing further. Progress. Measurable, undeniable progress.  
And yet—not enough.  
I paced the length of the lab, my boots clicking against the sterile tile. The problem wasn't the splicing. The animal traits took. Enhanced reflexes, night vision, heightened senses—all present. The issue was the body's inability to sustain the transformation. The necrosis. The systemic collapse.  
We needed a stronger host. A healthier one. Someone whose body could endure the strain.  
I stopped mid-step.  
The staff here were off-limits—they knew too much, had seen too many failures. I needed someone new. Someone untouched by the project's grim history.  
I left the lab without a word, my mind racing. The facility was vast, but the common areas were the most likely place to find an unfamiliar face. The break rooms, the lounges—somewhere a stranger might linger.  
The recreation lounge was nearly empty at this hour. Through the observation window, I saw a lone figure curled in an armchair—a girl with vibrant red hair and startling blue eyes, idly flipping through a magazine. Civilian clothes. No badge.  
A stranger.  
The door hissed as I entered. She didn't look up.  
"This area requires clearance," I said.  
Her fingers paused on the page. "Does it?"  
Blue eyes lifted to meet mine—sharp, assessing. No fear. Just quiet challenge.  
I stepped closer. "You're not staff."  
"And you're not Security." She marked her page with a finger. "So I'm guessing this isn't an official reprimand."  
A smirk tugged at my lips. Bold. I liked that.  
"Dr. Osyra Renaya," I said, extending a hand. "Genetics Division."  
She studied my outstretched palm for a beat before shaking it. "Layla." No last name offered. Her grip was firm, her skin warm with healthy circulation.  
"You're lost," I stated.  
"You're observant." She tilted her head. "Though if I were actually lost, wouldn't I be wandering the halls looking helpless?"  
I chuckled. "Then what brings you to a high-security research facility, Layla?"  
She shrugged, the movement deliberately casual. "Got bored waiting for my escort. Decided to explore."  
No nervous tells. Steady breathing. Excellent posture. Prime candidate.  
I leaned against the adjacent chair. "Your escort must be important to rate a personal tour."  
"Or just well-connected." A ghost of a smile. "You should see the looks I get when I name-drop my father."  
I filed that away—family connections meant she wasn't some random trespasser. But more importantly, it meant no one would immediately question her disappearance.  
"Since you're already breaking rules..." I lowered my voice conspiratorially. "Want to see something interesting?"  
Her eyes narrowed slightly. "Define 'interesting.'"  
"The kind of research that doesn't appear in press releases." I stood, offering my hand again. "Consider it a... private tour."  
For a long moment, she just studied me. Then, with deliberate slowness, she closed her magazine and stood.  
"Lead the way, Doctor."  
As we walked toward the labs, I noted her easy stride—no limps, no favoring of sides. Strong cardiovascular response. No visible genetic markers for degenerative conditions.  
Perfect.  
Elias nearly dropped his tablet when we entered. "Doctor, this area is—"  
"Authorized," I cut in, guiding Layla toward the observation window. "Our guest has special clearance."  
She pressed a hand to the glass, peering into the empty containment chamber. "What do you study here?"  
"The future of human evolution." My fingers found the prepared syringe in my pocket. "You're about to become part of it."  
The needle slipped between her ribs before she could react.  
Her body stiffened. Blue eyes flashed wide with betrayal—then fluttered shut as the sedative took hold.  
I caught her as she fell, her red hair spilling over my arm like a banner.  
"Prep the surgical suite," I ordered. "And bring the Chimera-8 series."  
Lina hesitated. "Doctor, she's not—"  
"The ideal candidate?" I adjusted my grip on Layla's limp form. "On the contrary. She's exactly what we need."  
The first true subject.  
The surgical lights burned white-hot overhead as Layla's unconscious form was secured to the table. Her red hair fanned across the sterile paper like spilled ink, stark against the clinical surroundings.  
"Administer Chimera-8," I ordered, watching the syringe's contents glint silver under the lights.  
The serum flowed into her veins—a perfect, measured dose. Then, before her body could react, the deceleration antidote followed, its viscous amber liquid neutralizing the necrosis triggers before they could take hold.  
We waited.  
Ten minutes passed in silence, broken only by the steady beep of the heart monitor. No convulsions. No blackened veins. No telltale signs of cellular decay.  
Layla's skin remained unblemished, her breathing even.  
I smiled. "See? Better. No decay."  
Elias shifted uncomfortably. "Doctor Renaya... this is outside protocol. She's not—"  
"—A Class D expendable?" I finished for him, adjusting the IV drip. "No. She's better."  
Lina's fingers hovered over the biometric readouts. "The Council didn't approve this."  
"The Council doesn't approve anything until after it works." I waved a hand dismissively. "Wake her up."  
A tense silence followed. Then, reluctantly, Elias pressed the stimulant injector to Layla's neck.  
Her eyelids fluttered.  
"What the hell—?" Her voice was rough, but steady. Human. Entirely unchanged.  
I forced a smile. "How do you feel?"  
She yanked against the wrist straps. "Like someone who's about to murder you! Let me go!"  
Standard human strength. No enhanced reflexes. No animalistic responses.  
A complete failure.  
Behind me, Lina exhaled quietly—whether in relief or disappointment, I couldn't tell.  
"Release her," I said flatly.  
Elias hesitated. "Doctor, we should at least run—"  
"I said release her."  
The moment the straps loosened, Layla scrambled off the table, backing toward the wall like a cornered animal—though there was nothing feral in her movements. Just ordinary, human fear.  
She touched her neck where the needle had gone in. "What did you inject me with?"  
"Nothing that took, apparently." I turned to my notes, already calculating adjustments for the next batch. Too much deceleration agent. Too little viral payload. The ratios needed—  
A hand grabbed my lab coat.  
Layla spun me around, her face inches from mine. Up close, her eyes were startlingly blue—and blazing with fury. "You kidnapped me. Drugged me. Experimented on me." Her grip tightened. "Give me one reason I shouldn't scream this place down right now."  
I studied her face. No pupil dilation. No heightened aggression. Just baseline human adrenaline.  
Pathetic.  
"You won't scream," I said calmly, "because you're smarter than that." I gestured to the security cameras in the corners. "This is a classified facility. Do you really think they'd let you walk out of here if you made a scene?"  
Her grip faltered.  
I pressed the advantage. "You're going to leave quietly. You'll report to Security at the front desk, tell them you got lost looking for the restroom. And then you'll never speak of this again—unless you want certain... complications to arise."  
A bluff, of course. The Council would have my head if they knew I'd taken an unauthorized subject. But she didn't know that.  
Layla's jaw worked. For a moment, I thought she might hit me. Then she released my coat with a shove.  
"This isn't over," she muttered.  
She stormed out, the door hissing shut behind her.  
Silence settled over the lab.  
Elias cleared his throat. "We should report the breach."  
"No." I turned back to my notes. "We should correct our mistakes."  
The serum was still in her system—dormant, but present. Maybe, given time...  
I tapped the stylus against the tablet.  
"Prepare the next trial. We'll halve the deceleration agent."  
Lina stared at me. "You can't seriously be considering—"  
"I'm considering science," I snapped. "Now get to work."  
Somewhere beyond the lab walls, Layla McKay was walking away unchanged.  
For now.  
The lab was too bright. Too loud. The hum of machinery grated against my skull as I paced near the mixing station, adjusting the antidote ratios for the next trial. The numbers swam before my eyes—just a slight reduction in deceleration agent, a minor tweak to the viral payload. Simple.  
Elias and Lina stood near the observation window, speaking in hushed tones. I ignored them. Their doubts were irrelevant. The work was all that mattered.  
"Subject inbound. ETA ten minutes." The coms crackled.  
"Understood," I muttered, not looking up from the vial in my hands. Just a little more antidote. Just enough to—  
"Doctor."  
Elias' voice was low. Firm.  
I didn't turn. "If you're about to waste my time with another moral objection, don't."  
A pause. Then, quieter: "Lina and I are resigning."  
That made me stop.  
I set the vial down slowly. Turned.  
Elias stood with his arms crossed, jaw tight. Lina hovered behind him, her fingers twisting the hem of her lab coat. Neither would meet my eyes.  
I laughed. "You don't resign from Site 17."  
"We can't keep doing this," Lina said softly. "You're not just pushing boundaries anymore. You're—"  
"What?" I snapped. "Making progress? Finally getting results?"  
Elias shook his head. "You're crossing lines even the Council wouldn't approve."  
I scoffed, turning back to the antidote. "The Council doesn't care about lines. They care about success. And I'm close."  
A beat of silence. Then—  
"Enjoy the meds, Doctor."  
A sharp, sudden pain lanced through my side.  
I gasped, whirling—  
Elias stood there, an empty syringe in his hand.  
_Chimera-9._  
The realization hit like ice water.  
No.  
No.  
I stumbled back, my hands flying to the injection site. Already, a deep, unnatural warmth was spreading through my veins.  
"You—" My voice was raw. "You idiot—"  
Elias set the syringe down calmly. "You were right about one thing, Doctor. The Council does care about success." His gaze was steady. Cold. "They just don't think you're the one who'll deliver it."  
My breath came too fast. My vision pulsed at the edges.  
No antidote.  
The vial on the table—not enough.  
Panic clawed up my throat. I lunged for the mixing station, my hands shaking violently as I grabbed the remaining antidote. No time for calculations. No time for precision.  
I stabbed the needle into my thigh and pushed.  
The world tilted.  
My knees hit the floor.  
Not enough. Not enough.  
The adrenaline was a wildfire in my blood, but beneath it—something darker. Something hungry.  
I fumbled for my coms device.  
"M-Mayday—"  
No. Wrong word. Didn't matter.  
The door hissed open.  
Shadows moved at the edges of my vision. Boots against tile. Voices—muffled, distant.  
I tried to speak.  
Darkness swallowed me whole.
