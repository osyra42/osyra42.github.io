Cover Letter:
Esteemed Members of the O5 Council, Ethics Committee, and Site-██ Administration,
In compliance with Directive ██████-██, I hereby submit my mandatory autobiographical statement for
archival and review. This document provides a detailed account of my personal history, professional
contributions, and interpersonal influences within the SCP Foundation. It is my understanding that this
statement will serve as a foundational record for future evaluations, operational assignments, and historical
reference.
As an Operator-level researcher, my career has been defined by a commitment to advancing the
Foundation’s mission through innovative research and strategic oversight. My current responsibilities involve
the operational management of a highly advanced artificial intelligence housed within a humanoid chassis,
designated as Autonomous Construct Vanity (classification pending). Prior to this role, I led Project Chimera
(Project ID: ██████), a classified initiative that achieved its primary objectives and was deemed a success by
the Ethics Committee and O5 Council. The outcomes of this project remain restricted to authorized personnel,
but its contributions to the Foundation’s understanding of anomalous systems have been noted in relevant
archives.

I am currently undergoing evaluation for reassignment to a Mobile Task Force, pending approval from the
Ethics Committee and O5 Council. This transition represents a natural progression in my career, as I seek to
apply my expertise in a more field-oriented capacity.
This document has been prepared with the utmost care and accuracy. Any gaps in the narrative have been
supplemented with verified data from Foundation archives and personnel files to ensure completeness and
compliance with archival standards. I trust that this statement will provide valuable insight into my
professional trajectory and contributions to the Foundation’s objectives.
Should further clarification or additional information be required, I remain available for consultation.
Respectfully submitted,
Dr. Osyra Renaya
Operator-Level Researcher
