# Chapter 03 - Burnt Toast and Solder

The house smelled like burnt toast, solder, and the rich, earthy aroma of freshly ground coffee beans.
Layla sat cross-legged on the living room rug, her tongue poking out in concentration as she glued popsicle
sticks into a lopsided arch. Behind her, the oscillating fan clicked rhythmically as it swept warm air across the
room, ruffling the pages of Eric’s abandoned engineering magazines. From the kitchen came the hiss of Alissa’s
soldering iron, the sharp, metallic tang of overheating circuits, and the quiet gurgle of the coffee machine as
Eric prepared a fresh pot.
He moved methodically, measuring the grounds with the precision of a chemist, his calloused fingers
tapping the counter as he waited for the machine to finish its work. The scent of coffee bloomed in the air—
dark and slightly nutty, with a hint of caramel from the beans he’d roasted himself last weekend.
A muffled curse came from Alissa as her code failed to compile. An edit, then another attempt. A pause.
Then, a quiet, triumphant click.
“Bug,” Alissa called, “come here a sec.”
Layla carefully set down her bridge—don’t smudge the glue—and padded into the kitchen, her bare feet
sticking slightly to the laminate floor where Eric had spilled a drop of syrup that morning. Alissa knelt by the
open guts of a desktop computer, her hair escaping its ponytail in frizzy tendrils. She grinned and tapped the
screen, where a black terminal window pulsed with green text:
USER: Hello?
SYSTEM: Greetings, human. State your query.
“It’s a chatbot,” Alissa said, wiping her hands on her jeans. “Dumber than a bag of rocks, but you can ask it
anything. Watch.” She typed rapidly:
USER: What’s the best bridge design?
The cursor blinked. Then:
SYSTEM: Define “best.” For stability: truss. For aesthetics: suspension. For passive-aggressive neighbors:
drawbridge.
Layla giggled. “It’s sassy.”
“Like someone else I know.” Alissa ruffled her hair just as the coffee machine beeped.
Eric poured himself a mug, the steam curling in the air, then hesitated. He glanced at Layla, his expression
softening. “You want a sip?”
Layla perked up. “Yeah?”
“Alright. Do you want some too, babe?” He turned, fetching a small, mismatched teacup from the cabinet—
the one with the chipped rim that Layla had claimed as hers years ago. He filled it barely a quarter of the way,
then topped it off with a splash of milk and a sprinkle of cinnamon, the way she liked it.
“Here,” he said, handing it to her. “Engineer’s fuel.”
Layla took the cup carefully, the warmth seeping into her fingers. She blew on it, then took a tiny sip. The
coffee was bitter, but the milk and cinnamon softened it, making it taste almost like dessert. She grinned.
“Perfect.”
Eric smirked. “Of course it is. I made it.”
Alissa rolled her eyes but didn’t protest, already typing another question into the chatbot.
Layla cradled the cup in both hands, the heat grounding her as she watched the words flicker on the screen.
Eric leaned against the counter, sipping his own coffee, his presence steady as the hum of the refrigerator.
Outside, thunder rumbled—the first warning of the storm moving in.
