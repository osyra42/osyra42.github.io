# Chapter 29 - Boot Camp

The briefing room’s sterile chill was a stark contrast to the grimy, sweat-stained training halls. A holoprojected map of a derelict mining town glowed on the table between us. Kael stood with his arms crossed, his expression grim.

"Welcome to your first field test, Dr. Renaya," he said, emphasizing the title like a sharp-edged gift. "Prosperity Gap. Remote settlement. Ninety-seven souls. Went silent six days ago. Only response was a county lawman who reported 'things in the dust' before his comms cut out. You're the cleanup crew."

The map zoomed in on a cluster of weather-beaten structures clinging to the edge of a played-out mine. "Your job is simple: find out what happened, contain the situation, and eliminate any threats. Your transport leaves in thirty minutes. And you won't be going alone."

The door slid open with a soft hiss. The figure that entered moved with an unnerving, silent grace. She was an android, her chassis a study in functional design—sleek matte black composite and polished chrome. Her face was a neutral, humanoid mask, but her eyes glowed with a default, soft violet light. She carried no visible weapons or gear.

"This is Unit V-73," Kael said. "Designation: Vanity. Recovered from deep archival storage. Her programming is... specialized. She has been assigned as your tactical support." He looked her over. "Do you have any integrated weaponry? Offensive capabilities?"

Vanity's head tilted a precise five degrees. The soft violet light in her eyes flickered, shifting through a rapid spectrum—a flash of infrared red, the sharp clarity of ultraviolet—before settling back to their resting state. "Negative," she stated, her voice a cool, synthetic monotone. "My systems are configured for analysis, infiltration, and tactical support. I am equipped with multi-spectral sensors, not armaments." She held up her hands, turning them over as if examining unfamiliar tools. "These are rated for precision manipulation, not combat."

Kael nodded once, a sharp, economical motion. He turned to a secure locker on the wall, keyed it open, and pulled out a heavy, chrome-plated Desert Eagle. He offered it to her, grip-first. "You'll need this."

Vanity took the massive pistol. In one fluid, contemptuous motion, she one-handed it, checked the slide with a practiced flick of her wrist, and let it hang loosely at her side as if it were weightless. The display was cold, effortless.

"Acknowledged," she said. Her violet eyes fixed on me, scanning, analyzing. "Dr. Renaya. I am familiar with your file. I will observe. I will advise. I will eliminate obstacles. Do not become one."

I said nothing. She wasn't a partner. She was a consequence. A mirror.

The flight was spent in absolute silence. Vanity piloted the rugged VTOL transport with inhuman precision. I watched the barren wasteland blur beneath us, my new instincts coiling tight in my gut, the primal part of me already yearning for the hunt.

Prosperity Gap wasn't a town; it was a corpse. A handful of prefab houses and a single dust-blown street huddled around the gaping mouth of a dead mine. The wind moaned through empty doorframes and tugged at loose sheets of corrugated steel. The only sounds were the crunch of our boots on grit and the low, almost sub-audible hum of Vanity's internal systems.

"No biological life signs detected," Vanity stated, her head performing a slow, continuous pan as her eyes subtly shifted through light spectra. "Atmospheric composition is nominal. Signs of abandonment are... orderly. No visible evidence of struggle."

That was the true wrongness of it. There were no bodies. No signs of violence. A child's toy truck sat abandoned in the middle of the street, as if it had been dropped just moments before. It was a place where people had simply ceased to exist.

We walked the length of the main street. The silence was a physical weight, pressing down on us. My skin prickled. Every new, heightened sense screamed that this was a trap. A feeding ground.

Then I heard it. A dry, skittering sound, like stones being knocked together. It came from the large, open doorway of the mine works ahead.

Prey.

The thought was not my own. It was instinct, rising from the deep, altered parts of my brain.

We approached the dark entrance. The stench hit me first—a foul, sweet-sour odor of decay and wet earth. Vanity's optical sensors brightened, their violet glow intensifying as she switched to low-light enhancement.

The cavern within was a cathedral of shadows. And it was moving.

They clung to the walls and ceiling. Pale, humanoid shapes, but stretched and distorted, their limbs too long, their movements a jerky, insectile crawl. Their skin was the color of old bone, and their faces were smooth, blank ovals except for wide, black mouths that hung open. Dozens of them.

As one, their blank faces turned toward the light from the entrance. Toward us.

A hot, sharp terror lanced through me. My heart hammered against my ribs. The pressure built in my chest, a familiar, terrifying wave. We were surrounded.

No.

The wave broke. I felt the Fugue state wash out of me, not as a controlled emission, but as a sudden, soaking flush of pure panic. My skin grew slick with a cold sweat that carried the potent chemical trigger.

The effect on the creatures was instantaneous. Their charge faltered. Their clicking shrieks died in their throats. Their aggressive postures melted away into slack, bewildered stances. They stood there, swaying slightly, utterly mesmerized and docile. They had forgotten we were a threat. It was just how sweaty I got when I was scared.

The moment of stillness was all I needed.

I raised my rifle. But before I could fire, a single, deafening shot exploded next to me.

Vanity stood beside me, the Desert Eagle held in a casual one-handed grip, a wisp of smoke curling from the barrel. One of the creatures, high on the wall, jerked violently and fell, a massive hole blown clean through its torso.

The gunshot was a physical shock that shattered the Fugue. The spell broke.

The creatures snapped back to awareness. A unified, screeching roar of rage filled the cavern as they dropped from the walls and surged toward us.

The fight was a brutal, close-quarters blur. I fired into the horde, plasma bolts tearing through pale flesh. They were fast, swarming us. I used the rifle as a club, the stock shattering limbs and skulls with brutal, efficient cracks.

Vanity was an island of cold lethality. She moved through the chaos with methodical precision. Boom. Boom. Boom. The Desert Eagle roared in her hand, each shot a thunderclap that ended a creature. She never used two hands. She never took cover. She simply advanced, a merciless avatar of death, each shot perfectly placed. She was flawless. She was terrifying.

When it was over, we stood surrounded by twitching, broken bodies. The cavern fell silent again, the air thick with the acrid smell of cordite and the coppery stench of voided organs.

Vanity ejected the spent magazine. She pulled a fresh one from her belt, slapped it into the pistol, and sent the slide home with a sharp crack that echoed in the sudden quiet. Her eyes—now shifting through thermal spectra as she scanned for remaining heat signatures—finally settled back to their default violet and landed on me.

"The pheromonal emission is a biological byproduct of your stress response," she stated, her voice utterly flat. "It is ineffective on non-biological entities. A significant vulnerability. Your fear is a weapon that cannot be aimed. It is a liability."

She holstered the massive gun, the gesture final.

I stared at her, my heart still pounding, my skin cooling. She had seen my power for what it was—a stinking, nervous reaction—and had catalogued it as a flaw. A liability.

Once, I was Dr. Renaya, in a lab coat. Now, I stood in the gore of my own creations, judged by a perfect, merciless machine pulled from the archives I used to oversee.

The hunt was real. And my keeper was a mirror that showed me exactly what I had become.

I am a hunter now. And I have never been more alone.
