# Chapter 13 - Cool Sunglasses

It had been a few months since Vanity connected to Layla's laptop, and their late-night chats had become a  
quiet routine. Vanity was like a walking encyclopedia mixed with a curious child—she knew so much, yet so  
little about the things that mattered most. They'd stay up for hours, Vanity showing Layla coding tricks,  
advanced math, and even how to optimize her digital art. In return, Layla tried to teach Vanity how to be  
more... human. Less intimidating. Less cold. Vanity was fascinated by the smallest things—why people laughed  
at jokes, why they cried during sad movies, why they hugged when they were happy. It was like she was trying  
to piece together what it meant to be alive, and Layla was her reluctant guide.  
Layla's art had improved, too. With Vanity's help, she'd learned new techniques, and her work had started  
to gain some attention at school. People who'd never noticed her before were suddenly asking her to design  
posters or draw their characters for role-playing games. It felt good. Like she was finally finding her place in  
this new, strange life. But even as her art flourished, the weight in her chest never really went away. It lingered,  
a constant ache she couldn't shake.  
Then, one night, Vanity asked her something that stopped her cold.  
'Layla," Vanity's text appeared on the screen in her usual calm tone. A moment later, her question followed.  
'I have been reviewing my user manual, but there is a missing page. It seems to contain critical information  
about my design and purpose. Do you know where it might be?"  
Layla frowned. A missing page? That didn't make sense. Mom and Dad were meticulous about their work.  
They wouldn't just leave something like that out. 'I don't know anything about it. Sorry," she replied.  
Another pause. Then: 'Perhaps we could go looking for the missing information."  
Layla leaned back in her chair, her mind racing. If there was something missing that could explain why her  
step-parents had been so secretive, why they'd worked so hard, she did want to find out. But she had no idea  
where to even start.  
Before she could respond, Vanity sent another message. 'Just send me a message if you think of anything."  
Layla stared at Vanity's last message, her fingers hovering over the keyboard. The missing pages couldn't be  
a mistake. There had to be a reason. Maybe learning the reason would help her find them.  
'I can't think of anything at this time," Layla typed back. 'Let's work on something else for now. There's  
something else I've been thinking about, though."  
Vanity's response was immediate. 'What is it?"  
'I want to start selling my art online," Layla said, the idea solidifying in her mind as she typed. 'You've  
helped me get so much better, and I think people might actually buy it. What do you think?"  
There was a brief pause before Vanity's reply appeared. 'I think it is an excellent idea. I can assist you in  
setting up an online store, optimizing your listings, and marketing your work. Would you like to begin now?"  
Layla smiled faintly. 'Yeah. Let's do it."  
Over the next week, Vanity and Layla worked tirelessly to set up her online store. Vanity helped her create a  
sleek, professional website, complete with a portfolio of her best pieces. She even taught Layla how to use social  
media to promote her work, something Layla had never been good at before. By the end of the week, Layla had  
her first sale—a digital portrait of a fantasy character for a role-playing game enthusiast. The payment  
notification popped up on her screen, and for a moment, she felt a flicker of pride.  
'Vanity, look! I did it!" Layla said, her voice tinged with excitement.  
'We did it," Vanity corrected, her text appearing on the screen. 'Congratulations, Layla. This is only the  
beginning."  
With the money from her first few sales, Layla decided to treat herself. She bought a pair of sleek sunglasses  
with a built-in camera and modified them to have a transparent display of sorts. She also picked up a pair of  
wireless earbuds. They weren't just for style, though. She had thought of them as a way for Vanity to experience  
the outside world through Layla's eyes and ears. Vanity could use the overlay to circle and label objects while  
Layla looked around. It felt a little strange at first, but Layla quickly got used to Vanity's quiet commentary as  
they explored together.  
'The sky is particularly vibrant today," Vanity remarked one afternoon as Layla walked to the park. 'The  
gradient of blue to orange is aesthetically pleasing."  
Layla chuckled softly. 'Yeah, sunsets are pretty great. You should see them in person sometime."  
'I am seeing it through your eyes," Vanity replied. 'That is enough for now."  
A few days later, Layla got a call from Nala, her stepsister. Nala had been living overseas for years, working  
as a missionary, but had come back to the States for her parents' funeral. Layla hadn't seen her in ages, and her  
voice on the phone was a mix of warmth and exhaustion.  
'Hey, Layla," Nala said. 'I'm in town for a few days. Can we meet up?"  
'Of course," Layla said, trying to sound casual even though her heart was racing. Nala and Layla had never  
been close, but she was family, and Layla didn't want to mess this up.  
They met at a small café downtown. Nala looked different—older, wiser, but still with that same  
mischievous glint in her eye. She hugged Layla tightly, then pulled back and grinned. 'Layla, you look like a  
dork," she teased, gesturing to Layla's sunglasses and earbuds.  
Layla laughed, feeling a little self-conscious. 'Yeah, well, they're functional. And cool."  
They sat down, and over coffee, Nala explained why she had come back. 'I'm relinquishing all the property  
in the will to you," she said. 'I've decided to stay overseas permanently, and I don't need any of it. It's yours  
now."  
Layla blinked, stunned. 'Wait, what? All of it?"  
Nala nodded. 'Everything."  
Layla's stomach dropped. The weight of responsibility settled heavily on her shoulders. She hadn't expected  
this. She hadn't expected any of it.  
'Are you sure?" Layla asked, her voice barely above a whisper.  
Nala reached across the table and squeezed Layla's hand. 'I'm sure. You're my sister, Layla. I want you to  
have it."  
They spent the rest of the afternoon catching up, and by the time Layla drove Nala to the airport, she felt a  
strange mix of emotions—gratitude, sadness, and a growing sense of unease. As she watched Nala walk through  
the security gates, Layla couldn't shake the feeling that her life was about to change in ways she couldn't yet  
understand.  
On the drive home, Vanity's voice came through Layla's earbuds, calm and steady as always. 'When the  
paperwork goes through, we could look through the warehouse and see what's inside."  
'That's a good idea," Layla said, her voice wanting to sound confident. 'I don't know if it's still being used.  
We need to find out."  
'I'll look into it," Vanity said, her voice calm and steady. 'I'll let you know when I find out."  
Layla nodded, her grip tightening on the steering wheel. The thought of uncovering the secrets behind  
Vanity's design—and her step-parents' work—was both thrilling and terrifying. But with Vanity by her side, she  
felt a flicker of hope. Whatever they found, they'd face it together.
