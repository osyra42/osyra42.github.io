# Chapter 17 - The Mighty Pen

The door handle turned with unsettling smoothness, as if recently oiled. The armed guard standing post  
didn't react to my emergence, his gaze fixed on some invisible point down the sterile hallway. His tactical vest  
bore no insignia, his expression no readable emotion.  
"Dr. Renaya," he stated flatly, not a greeting so much as an acknowledgment of my existence. The title sent  
an involuntary shiver down my spine.  
"Where am I?" My voice sounded small against the hum of hidden ventilation systems.  
"Orientation required before disclosure," the guard said, eyes still forward. "Proceed to compartment B7."  
The corridor stretched in both directions, lined with identical white doors bearing alphanumeric codes  
instead of names.  
The third door on the left stood slightly ajar, warm yellow light spilling into the cold hallway. Before I could  
knock, a rich baritone voice called out:  
"Ah! Our star recruit! Please, come in!"  
Dr. Miller's office was a carefully crafted oasis—bookshelves of leather-bound volumes, a Persian rug  
underfoot, the faint scent of bergamot in the air. The man himself rose from an ergonomic chair, his tweed  
jacket and salt-and-pepper beard giving him the air of a distinguished professor. His smile reached his eyes in a  
way that should have been comforting.  
"Osyra, isn't it?" He gestured to a plush armchair. "I'd offer you tea, but I suspect you'd prefer answers  
first."  
I remained standing, my fingers gripping the chair back. "You suspect correctly. Where am I?"  
"This is Site 17," he said.  
"Site 17?"  
"Yes," he replied, as a matter of factly, with no other explanation.  
I stared at him, waiting for more. None came.  
"Yesterday I was defending my thesis at—"  
"At Columbia, yes." He nodded sympathetically, pouring steaming water into an actual china cup. "Creative  
but insufficient, wasn't it? Such a shame." The delicate clink of the spoon against porcelain was obscenely  
normal. "Tell me, do you believe a committee of tenured bureaucrats should determine what constitutes real  
science?"  
The question caught me off guard. "That's not—"  
"Because we don't." He gestured to the window overlooking a sprawling research complex that shouldn't  
exist. "That building contains a synchrotron light source smaller than your university's cyclotron but three  
times as powerful. Our clean rooms make NASA look sloppy." He sipped his tea. "Yet we have no review  
boards. No grant committees. Just results."  
My reflection in the glass looked hollow - dark circles under my eyes, my hair still mussed from whatever  
they'd used to transport me here. The equipment visible through the blinds was beyond state-of-the-art.  
"Why am I here?"  
"Because your viral vector research is brilliant." He said it like stating a simple fact. "That university would  
have buried it in some third-tier journal. We want to see it change the world."  
The tablet he slid across the desk displayed a contract. The salary made my throat constrict - more than my  
parents ever earned combined. The benefits package included things like "on-site residential accommodations"  
and "unlimited research budget."  
"This is... I never applied—"  
"Applied?" Dr. Miller chuckled. "Einstein didn't apply to Princeton. Turing didn't apply to Bletchley Park.  
Real discoveries aren't made through HR departments." He tapped the screen, enlarging a clause about  
intellectual property rights. "You'll retain full patent ownership. We only ask for first refusal on  
commercialization."  
My hands trembled slightly. The numbers were staggering. The equipment... I could finally test my theories  
properly. No more begging for lab time. No more—  
I caught myself. "You kidnapped me."  
"Did we?" His eyebrow arched. "Or did we save you?" Another tap brought up my student loan balance - a  
number I checked obsessively every morning. "How many years of post-doc purgatory were you facing? Five?  
Six? All for the privilege of begging scraps from—"  
"The work is dangerous," I interrupted. "The ethics review board—"  
"—Would have strangled it in its cradle." He leaned forward, his voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper.  
"Osyra, every medical breakthrough was called unethical by someone. Penicillin was considered dangerous  
when first isolated. mRNA vaccines were theoretical nonsense until suddenly they weren't."  
The guard outside shifted his weight slightly, the sound of his gear adjusting barely audible through the  
door. A reminder that for all the comfortable trappings, I wasn't free to leave.  
Dr. Miller followed my gaze toward the guard and sighed. "Thomas is just doing his job. You're free to walk  
out that door whenever you wish." He gestured to a second exit I hadn't noticed—unlocked, unguarded. "But  
before you do..." He tapped the tablet again.  
The screen flickered to life, displaying a simulation. Not live footage, but a rendering: a high-containment  
lab, technicians in biosafety suits moving with rehearsed precision. My notes on the whiteboard. My designs on  
the workstations. A sterile, perfect vision of what could be.  
"They're not real," I said.  
"Not yet." His voice was low, conspiratorial. "This is what we build if you say yes. No grant committees. No  
ethics panels tripping over hypotheticals. Just the work, pure and unfiltered." He zoomed in on a bioreactor—  
smaller, faster, more efficient than anything in my old lab. "You've seen the limitations of academic research.  
This is what happens when those limitations don't exist."  
I stared at the screen. It was a fantasy. A provocation. And yet—  
The stylus lay beside the tablet. The contract's terms still glowed: unlimited resources, full autonomy, a  
salary that erased a decade of debt in a year.  
"You're asking me to trust a simulation," I said.  
He smiled. "I'm asking you to trust yourself. The science is sound. The only variable left... is you."  
The hum of the ventilation system filled the silence. Somewhere beyond the door, machinery thrummed, a  
distant heartbeat.  
I picked up the stylus.
