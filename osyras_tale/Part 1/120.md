# Chapter 20 - Well Technically

The farmhouse stood at the end of a gravel driveway, its wraparound porch still smelling of fresh lumber.  
Three months had passed since Layla sold the old McKay Robotics warehouse to Daniel Harris—the facility  
manager who had practically begged to take it off her hands. She hadn't fought him on the price. Maintaining  
that cavernous, echo-filled space was a relic of a life she no longer wanted.  
Instead, she'd bought this place—ten acres of overgrown land just far enough outside the city that Vanity  
wouldn't draw unwanted attention. The house itself was a fixer-upper, but Layla didn't mind. She'd spent the  
first month rewiring the entire electrical system herself, splicing in military-grade surge protectors and fiberoptic conduits beneath the floorboards. The second month had been dedicated to soundproofing the basement,  
turning it into a workshop where she could dismantle, rebuild, and experiment without interruption.  
And the third month?  
That had been for learning.  
With the warehouse sold and her parents' estate settled, Layla had no need for a job. The money from the  
sale—along with what remained of her father's patents—meant she could afford to do nothing but study. And  
study she did.  
Vanity had become her tutor, her mentor, her relentless drill instructor.  
Layla had always been good with machines, but now she was obsessed. She tore through textbooks on  
quantum computing, neural networks, cryptographic algorithms. She spent nights writing and rewriting code,  
building and rebuilding circuits, until her fingers cramped and her vision blurred. Vanity never let her cut  
corners.  
"Again," the android would say, watching as Layla reassembled a processor blindfolded. "Faster."  
"This encryption is weak. Break it."  
"Your neural architecture is inefficient. Redesign it."  
Layla hated it. She loved it. It was the only thing that kept the silence at bay.  
Vanity materialized in the doorway, holding a cream-colored envelope between two fingers. "You have a  
letter."  
Layla's spine straightened. She'd almost forgotten about the request forms she'd submitted months ago—  
buried under layers of bureaucratic red tape and government processing times. The thick paper felt alien in her  
ink-stained hands as she tore it open.  
Component X-427 assembly complete.  
In-person installation required.  
Transport arrives 10/23 at 12:00 EST.  
Be prepared for 72-hour calibration period.  
A thrill shot through her sleep-deprived haze. "They actually approved it."  
Vanity's ocular sensors flickered as she analyzed the document. "The paper contains trace barium sulfate—  
standard for DOD contractors." Her head tilted. "Though the watermark pattern suggests deeper clearance  
than your application warranted."  
Layla rubbed her gritty eyes. Of course Vanity would notice that. The android missed nothing.  
Through the rain-streaked window, Nancy's silhouette moved through the backyard, tending to the storage  
shed that held the last physical remnants of Layla's parents. The sight sent the familiar ache through Layla's  
chest—the one no amount of caffeine or soldering could burn away.  
"You never told me what this component does," Vanity observed.  
Layla tapped the envelope against her palm. "We never read the document remember?"  
A rare pause from the android. "Maybe a Quantum decryption module."  
"You're guessing, stop guessing."  
The letter's arrival changed everything. The aimless months of tinkering, the restless nights tearing apart  
electronics—all of it had been killing time until this moment. Layla's fingers itched to dig into hardware that  
didn't exist on any civilian marketplace.  
Vanity's voice cut through her thoughts. "You do realize this likely connects to Site 17."  
Layla's stomach tightened. The name still sent a jolt through her, even months after that mysterious  
package. She'd combed every database, called in favors from her shadiest contacts—nothing. Until now.  
Nancy's laughter floated in from the garden, warm and unconcerned.  
"Are you going to tell her," Vanity stated.  
Layla folded the letter with deliberate care. "I'll have to."  
Layla exhaled through her nose, the letter's crisp edge digging into her palm. Nancy's laughter drifted in  
again, bright and unburdened—the exact opposite of everything churning inside Layla's chest.  
I'll have to.  
The words tasted like a lie.  
Vanity's gaze was a physical weight. "Probability suggests you'll delay disclosure until the last possible  
moment."  
"Shut up." Layla shoved the letter into her back pocket, the paper crinkling in protest. "I'll tell her tonight."  
A hum from the android—not quite disbelief, but close.  
Outside, the rain had eased to a drizzle. Nancy knelt by the overgrown flower beds, her gloves caked with  
mud as she wrestled with something stubbornly rooted. The storage shed behind her loomed like a shadow, its  
padlock gleaming faintly in the damp air. Layla hadn't stepped inside since they'd moved in. Some boxes were  
better left unopened.  
Vanity's voice was deceptively mild. "The transport will require security bypasses I can't implement without  
Nancy's biometrics."  
Layla's jaw tightened. Of course. Nothing was ever simple.  
She pushed open the screen door, the hinges whining in protest. The porch steps creaked under her weight  
as she crossed the yard, gravel crunching beneath her boots.  
Nancy glanced up, her smile fading when she saw Layla's face. "Oh no. What's broken now?"  
"Nothing's broken." Layla hesitated. The lie coiled on her tongue, ready—just a parts delivery, no big deal—  
but the envelope in her pocket burned like a brand.  
Vanity observed from the porch, impassive.  
Layla crouched beside Nancy, the damp earth soaking into her jeans. "Remember that government form I  
filed? The one you signed blind because I said ‘trust me'?"  
Nancy yanked a weed free with more force than necessary. "The one you wouldn't explain, even when I  
asked three times?"  
"Yeah. That one." Layla pulled out the letter, now smudged with dirt and engine grease. "They approved it."  
Nancy's gloves paused mid-motion. "Okay...?"  
"The thing is..." Layla unfolded the paper, revealing the stark black print. "It's not just a part. It's a package.  
From Site 17."  
The name landed between them like a live wire.  
Nancy went very still. The shed's padlock rattled in the wind.  
"You promised," she said quietly, "no more secrets."  
Layla stared at the mud streaking Nancy's knees. "I know."  
A beat passed. Then Nancy snatched the letter, her eyes scanning the lines with terrifying speed. "Seventytwo-hour calibration? Layla, what the hell did you order?"  
"That's the fun part." Layla forced a grin. "I have no idea."  
Vanity chose that moment to descend the porch steps. "Correction," she interjected. "You intentionally filed  
ambiguous paperwork to exploit bureaucratic loopholes. Statistically, there's a 67% chance you've acquired  
restricted quantum hardware."  
Nancy's glare could have melted steel.  
Layla held up her hands. "In my defense, I did warn you living with me would be weird."  
The first rumble of an engine cut through the trees—deep, diesel-heavy, official.  
All three turned toward the driveway.  
A matte-black armored truck rolled into view, its windshield tinted opaque.  
"Right on time," Vanity observed.  
Nancy slowly peeled off her gardening gloves. "We are talking about this."  
Layla watched the truck's reinforced doors swing open.  
Too late now.
