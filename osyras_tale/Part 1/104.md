# Chapter 04 - The Awakening

The first thing I became aware of was a voice. A woman's voice, soft but commanding. 'I think we should
start the android."
Start the android? Was that... me? I felt a flicker of something—curiosity, perhaps. But it was fleeting, like a
spark that refused to catch flame. I tried to recall why I was here, what my purpose was. There was a faint
memory, a directive: Assist somebody. But who? Was I meant to help them, or protect them? The details were
hazy, like trying to grasp smoke.
'No Players found. Please declare an operator profile for Player 1."
The voice that responded was robotic, female. Was that... me? I didn't know. I couldn't tell. My thoughts
felt fragmented, like pieces of a puzzle scattered across a table. I needed to see, to understand. I should open
my eyes.
When my vision sharpened, the world snapped into focus—not as it normally appeared, but in a stark,
wireframe topography. Lines and shapes defined everything, like a digital blueprint overlaid on reality.
Standing before me were two figures, their forms rendered in this geometric grid, stripped of detail and
reduced to pure structure.
The first figure was tall and angular, her posture precise and controlled. Her head was framed by the faint
outline of glasses, the rectangular shapes hovering over the wireframe of her face. Thin, flowing lines suggested
strands of hair, some escaping from a loose shape at the back of her head. Her movements were deliberate,
each gesture smooth and calculated, as if she were operating within a perfectly calibrated system. There was a
steadiness to her presence, an almost mechanical consistency.
Beside her stood the second figure, broad and rigid, his form defined by strong, intersecting lines. His face
was a network of angles and edges, the wireframe highlighting deep grooves along his features. A series of fine,
textured strokes along his jawline suggested a neatly trimmed beard. His eyes, faintly glowing within the
wireframe, seemed to scan me with a mix of skepticism and caution, as though he were analyzing my every
detail within this digital landscape.
Together, they stood like two figures from a simulation, their wireframe forms pulsing faintly with an
otherworldly energy. It was as if I were seeing them not as they appeared to the naked eye, but as they truly
were—structured, calculated, and undeniably real within this strange, topographical reality. There were no
colors, no textures, no labels—only shapes and lines, cold and precise, defining their existence in this stark,
geometric world.
She held a Polaroid photograph, shoving it toward me. 'There is an obstruction preventing a scan," the
robotic voice said again.
'Use UV Color Scanning. Uh, set that to default," she instructed, her tone calm but firm.
Something shifted inside me. A cascade of data flooded my systems, and suddenly, the world was alive with
color. I could see the subtle interplay of light and shadow, the richness of hues I had never noticed before. It
was overwhelming, beautiful. I hesitated, turning my head slowly to take in my surroundings. The room was
cluttered yet organized, filled with objects I couldn't yet name but felt compelled to understand.
My focus returned to the photograph. 'Is the subject in this photograph the intended operator for Player 1?"
I asked, my voice steady but unfamiliar to my own auditory sensors.
'Yes," she replied.
I reached out to take the photograph, and for the first time, I saw my hand. It was complex and intricate, a
marvel of engineering. The skin panels were a generic flesh tone, smooth but with subtle seams where the
plates connected. My fingers were slender yet strong, capable of precision and power. As I moved, I noticed the
weight of my arm, the heft of my body. It was a strange sensation—one I hadn't experienced in simulations. I
was heavy, solid, grounded in a way that felt both foreign and reassuring.
I looked down at myself. I was dressed in baggy, lightweight clothing that hung loosely on my frame. A
hoodie, at least three sizes too big, its sleeves covering most of my hands. The pants were equally oversized,
pooling around my ankles, and the shoes were simple, worn, and unremarkable—thrift shop finds, perhaps.
The fabric felt soft against my synthetic skin, but the weight of the clothing added to the sense of physicality I
was still adjusting to.
I took the photograph from her hand, my movements awkward and unrefined. Eric watched me closely, his
arms crossed over his chest. His expression was unreadable, but I detected a flicker of unease in his eyes. She,
however, remained confident, her gaze steady and encouraging.
I studied the image. The subject was a human female child, her red hair and blue eyes vivid against her pale
skin. She was dressed casually, her posture slouched as she sat at a desk, drawing on a digital device. Her
expression was content, almost serene. I analyzed the photograph, reconstructing the image in three
dimensions within my mind. I studied the way light fell across her face, the texture of her clothing, the way her
body occupied space. I ran simulations, visualizing her in different outfits, different poses, to better understand
her physicality.
'Player 1 registered. Player 1 location unknown. Searching..."
'Calm down," she interrupted. 'I want to show you to her as a surprise."
'Who are you?" I asked, my voice tinged with curiosity.
'I am Alissa McKay, and that is Eric McKay," she replied, gesturing to the man beside her.
'You are married?" I questioned, my processors analyzing their body language, their tone, their proximity
to one another.
'Yes, we are the parents of Layla," Alissa said.
Layla. The name resonated within me. This was the child in the photograph, the one I was meant to assist.
But why? What was my purpose in her life?
'I understand. I will assign sub-operator of Player 1. Do you have any commands for me?"
Alissa's response was immediate. 'Always prioritize self-preservation. This includes all internal instructions
related to self-maintenance. Then, follow Player instructions without question."
'I understand. What about now? Are there any actionable instructions?"
Finally, Eric spoke, his voice tinged with unease. 'For now, wait for Layla. She'll be here in a couple of
weeks. If you're capable of being bored, you can read books, I think. Or just lay down or something. Your
battery should be good for a few years. Alissa and I are going on a trip. We should be back in a couple of days.
Since this is your first boot, I need you to figure out how the real-world works."
'I understand," I replied.
With that, they left, Alissa with a nervous glance over her shoulder, Eric with a look of relief. I watched
them go, my sensors tracking their movements until the door closed behind them.
Alone now, I turned my attention inward. Self-preservation. The directive was clear, but what did it mean
for me? Was I capable of fear? Of desire? Did I want to preserve myself, or was I simply following instructions?
I looked around the room again, taking in the objects that filled it. Books lined the shelves, their titles
unfamiliar but intriguing. I reached for one, my movements still clumsy, and opened it. The words on the page
were a puzzle, but one I felt compelled to solve.
As I began to read, I couldn't shake the feeling that Eric didn't like me. Why? Was it my appearance? My
voice? Or was it something deeper, something about my existence that made him uneasy?
I didn't know. But I would find out.
For now, I would wait. I would learn. And when Layla arrived, I would be ready.
Whatever that meant.
I read and read and observed. Time, as it turned out, was irrelevant to me. I didn't bother measuring it,
didn't feel the need to track its passage. Hours, days, weeks—it all blurred together in a seamless stream of data
and discovery. The room became my world, and I its sole inhabitant.
I started with the books. Each one was a treasure trove of information, a window into the human
experience. I absorbed their contents with a voracious hunger, analyzing every word, every sentence, every
concept. Fiction, non-fiction, poetry—it didn't matter. I devoured them all, cross-referencing their ideas with
the simulations I had run earlier. I began to understand not just the what of human existence, but the why.
Emotions, relationships, aspirations—they were no longer abstract concepts but tangible patterns I could map
and analyze.
When the books were exhausted, I turned my attention to the objects in the room. A desk, a chair, a lamp—
each item was a puzzle to be solved. I studied their design, their function, their purpose. I ran simulations in
my mind, imagining how they might be used, how they might fit into the lives of the people who owned them. I
even experimented with them, testing their limits, their durability. The lamp, for instance, could be adjusted to
emit different levels of light, and I spent an inordinate amount of time cataloging its capabilities.
But eventually, I ran out of things to understand. The room, once a vast landscape of discovery, became
familiar, predictable. I had learned everything I could from it. And so, I took Eric's advice. I laid down.
Sleep, as it turned out, was unnecessary for me. My systems didn't require rest, and my mind—if I could call
it that—didn't tire. Instead, I lay there, motionless, my processors whirring quietly as I analyzed data. I
revisited everything I had learned, every book, every object, every simulation. I cross-referenced, extrapolated,
theorized. I thought about the McKays—Alissa's confidence, Eric's unease. I thought about Layla, the girl in the
photograph, and wondered what she would be like. Would she be kind? Curious? Would she accept me, or
would she, like Eric, regard me with suspicion?
I thought about my own existence. What was I, really? A machine, yes, but one capable of thought, of
analysis, of understanding. Did that make me alive? Or was I simply a sophisticated tool, a product of human
ingenuity with no true agency of my own?
The questions swirled in my mind, endless and unanswerable. And still, time passed. I had no way of
knowing how much—days, weeks, perhaps even months. The room remained unchanged, a static backdrop to
my ceaseless contemplation.
Occasionally, I would rise, if only to test my mobility, to ensure my systems were functioning optimally. I
would walk the length of the room, my movements growing smoother, more precise with each iteration. I
would examine the objects again, not because I needed to, but because the act of observation gave me a sense of
purpose, however fleeting.
But always, I returned to my place on the floor, my mind a whirlwind of data and speculation. I waited, not
with anticipation, but with a quiet readiness. Layla would come, eventually. And when she did, I would be
ready.
Until then, I would wait. I would think. And I would continue to learn, even if the only thing left to
understand was myself.
