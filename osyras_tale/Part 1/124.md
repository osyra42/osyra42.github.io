# Chapter 24 - Reassignment 

The silence that followed Lina's question was a fragile thing, shattered by the precise knock on the door. It slid open to reveal not just orderlies, but Dr. Aris, the facility's senior physician, his face a mask of professional concern, and a man who could only be described as a wall of military-grade muscle. He stood a head taller than Aris, his posture ramrod straight, his gaze scanning the room with tactical efficiency before landing on me. This was no med-tech.

'Dr. Renaya," Dr. Aris began, his voice calm but carrying an edge of intense curiosity. 'This is Master Sergeant Corvin. We're here for your preliminary assessment." His eyes were already darting to the readouts on the still-active heart monitor, his brow furrowing at the slow, steady rhythm. Lina took a measured step back, her presence receding into the role of observer.

The Sergeant didn't speak. He just watched, his arms crossed over a broad chest, as Dr. Aris approached with his scanner.

'Heart rate 38 bpm. Core temperature 39.1. Pupillary response is hyper-reactive," Aris murmured, more to himself than to us. He ran a biospectral scanner. 'Metabolic activity is... unprecedented. Neural pathways show significant rerouting." He leaned in closer, and as he did, his sleeve brushed my arm.

A jolt of pure, instinctual panic shot through me. The air in the room seemed to thicken, to hum.

Dr. Aris froze. He straightened up, his gaze drifting to the ceiling tiles, his expression going slack and utterly placid. He stood there, holding the scanner, completely still.

'Doctor?" Lina's voice was sharp.

He blinked, shaking his head as if clearing water from his ears. 'I... apologies. A momentary lapse." He looked at the scanner in his hand with confusion, then back at me, his professional mask now firmly back in place, though his eyes held a new, wary flicker. He'd felt it.

Sergeant Corvin's stony expression didn't change, but his eyes narrowed almost imperceptibly. He had seen it, too.

The secret was out before it had even been a secret. I was a specimen, and my cage was a hospital room under the most intense scrutiny.

The following days were a relentless battery of official tests. Dr. Aris and his team documented every biological mystery—the preternaturally slow vitals, the elevated core temperature, the bizarre neural patterns. But the physical assessment was handed over to Sergeant Corvin. He was a man of few words and brutal efficiency.

We started in a dedicated physio-lab, under the watchful eyes of both Corvin and Dr. Aris from the observation window. Elias was a frequent ghost behind the plasteel, his face a mix of avarice and profound irritation. My failure had become his most perplexing anomaly.

Corvin put me through my paces with a cold, dispassionate intensity. The treadmill was his first tool. He set a punishing pace, his expression expecting immediate failure. Minutes ticked by. Then ten. Then twenty. The machine's safety limits cut out with a warning beep. I was breathing deeply but evenly, my heart rate having climbed to a mere 90 bpm. Corvin's stony facade cracked for a single second, revealing pure disbelief. He grunted, made a note on his datapad, and moved on.

Strength tests were next. A hydraulic grip meter. I squeezed, expecting a moderate readout. The needle shot into the red zone, peaking at a value that made Corvin whistle softly, a low, appreciative sound. 'Well, I'll be damned," he muttered. 'That's stronger than me." He had me demonstrate a deadlift. The weights he stacked on, meant to be a maximum effort test for a highly trained soldier, I lifted with a stable core and straight back. The physical power was not explosive, but immense, deep, and enduring. My body was a masterpiece of endurance and force.

But the true strangeness emerged during a complex agility drill. Corvin was barking instructions, timing my movements through a reaction course. Halfway through, his voice faltered. I finished the sequence and turned to find him staring blankly at his stopwatch, his posture slack, his fierce concentration utterly dissolved.

'Sergeant?" I prompted.

He jerked, blinking rapidly. 'Proceed to the next station," he snapped, but his voice lacked its previous force. It happened twice more that session. A fog seemed to descend over him whenever the physical exertion spiked my adrenaline. He would forget the next command, or simply stand, mesmerized and docile, until I spoke. He never mentioned it, but his notes grew more terse, and his watchful gaze held a new, unsettled respect.

The cognitive assessments, overseen by Dr. Aris, were a different kind of revelation. They put me in front of terminals loaded with my own research. The complex, elegant biological models I had designed now felt like a foreign language. I could understand the principles, the grand architecture of the ideas, but the minute details, the rapid synaptic leaps of intuition that had been my trademark, were gone. I was slower. Methodical where I had been brilliant. It was like trying to perform surgery with oven mitts on. A core part of my identity had been scooped out and replaced with something... simpler.

They began to log the 'Fugue Effect." It was attributed to a novel class of psychoactive pheromones my new endocrine system emitted under stress. Elias's reports treated it as a curious, largely inconvenient side-effect of the 'neurological damage." He saw a broken tool, its useful parts—the physical enhancements—to be reverse-engineered, and its flaws—the fugue state and cognitive decline—to be eliminated.

He was so busy looking at the data, he refused to see the subject.

The summons to the conference room was inevitable. I was escorted by two security personnel. The message was clear: I was both a valuable asset and a potential threat.

Elias sat at the head of the table in Room 7B, the two Council members flanking him. Dr. Aris and Sergeant Corvin were also present, standing against the wall like opposing statues—one of science, one of strength. Lina was there, a silent shadow.

'The data is conclusive," Elias began, gesturing to screens displaying charts of my physical and cognitive metrics. 'A systemic metamorphosis. Physical capabilities, as documented by Sergeant Corvin, are enhanced beyond precedent. Cognitive function, however, has markedly degraded, particularly in your field of expertise. A tragic irony." He said it with a scientist's cold curiosity, but I could see the triumph in his eyes.

'Furthermore," a Council member said, 'the ‘Fugue Effect' presents an unacceptable disruption. It cannot be controlled."

'Precisely," Elias cut in. 'Therefore, your reassignment is necessary. Your security clearance is revoked. All your research assets are transferred to my Chimera-9 project. You will report to Archival and Sanitization for duty." He delivered the humiliating sentence with relish. A janitor. A ghost scrubbing the labs of the living.

I sat there, feeling the dense muscle in my back, the weight of the tail I kept carefully still beneath my chair, the sensitive ears I forced to remain passive. I let my face show a dull, confused acceptance. I was playing the part he'd written for me.

But then Elias made a mistake. He leaned forward, his voice dropping into a condescending whisper. 'Don't worry, Osyra. We'll learn from your... imperfections. Your body's strength will be replicated. Your mind's weakness, and these emotional pheromones, will be designed out. Your legacy will be perfection."

Emotional pheromones. He reduced the terrifying, predatory power to a hysterical flaw.

A hot, sharp anger flared in my chest, cutting through the cognitive fog. It was a clean, pure feeling. My tail gave a single, involuntary twitch under the chair, a thump against the leg.

The air tightened.

Elias's gloating expression softened. His eyes lost their focus, drifting to the tabletop. He blinked slowly. The Council member to his right subtly shook her head. Dr. Aris's hand, holding a datapad, went still. Sergeant Corvin, for the first time, looked not alert, but placid, his formidable presence momentarily disarmed. For three heartbeats, there was only silence. They had forgotten what they were doing.

'I... yes," Elias mumbled, straightening up and visibly grappling for his lost train of thought. He looked at the dismissal papers. 'The, uh, reassignment is effective immediately. See that she's processed." He dismissed me, turning away, the moment of fugue already buried under his arrogance.

He never saw it. He believed his own conclusion so completely that he was blind to the truth sitting across from him.

I was not broken. I was optimized. The mind that designed the weapon was no longer needed. The body that wielded it was now perfect. And the instinct to make my prey stand still and forget I was coming? That wasn't a flaw. It was the most terrifying feature of all.

As the security personnel moved to escort me out, I caught Lina's eye. There was no fear in her gaze now, only a fierce, blazing certainty.

The experiment was over. The assessment was complete. They thought they were reassigning a broken tool to the archives.

They were wrong. They were giving a predator the keys to the coop.
