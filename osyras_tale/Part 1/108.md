# Chapter 08 – Somehow Good News

I woke up to the sound of static and faint music drifting down the hallway. For a moment, I forgot where I
was. The room was unfamiliar—soft yellow walls, a quilt with tiny flowers, and a bookshelf filled with old
novels and knickknacks. Then it hit me. This wasn't my room. This wasn't my house. This was Nancy's house.
My house now.
I sat up slowly, pulling the quilt around my shoulders. It smelled like lavender, the same smell that clung to
Nancy's clothes. I didn't hate it, but it wasn't home. Home was the smell of coffee and printer ink, the sound of
Mom typing furiously on her keyboard, and Dad humming as he sketched blueprints at the dining table. Home
was gone.
But I wanted to go back. I wanted to go back so badly it hurt. I wanted to sit at the kitchen table and watch
Mom code while Dad explained his latest project. I wanted to dig in the sandbox and pretend I was building
something important, like Dad did. I wanted to hear Mom call me 'bug" and ruffle my hair. I wanted to go
home.
The music from the radio grew louder as I walked into the kitchen. Nancy was standing by the stove,
flipping pancakes and humming along to an old song I didn't recognize. The radio on the counter was one of
those big, boxy ones with a dial that clicked when you turned it. The sound was a little fuzzy, but Nancy didn't
seem to mind.
'Good morning, sweetheart," she said, turning to smile at me. 'Sleep okay?"
I nodded, even though I hadn't. I'd had the same dream again—the one where I was standing in the
sandbox, calling for Mom and Dad, but they never came.
Nancy poured a glass of orange juice and set it on the table for me. 'We've got a big day ahead of us," she
said, her voice light, like it was no big deal. 'But don't worry, we'll get through it together."
I poked at the pancakes with my fork. 'Where are we going today?"
'Just a few meetings," Nancy said. 'Some people need to talk to us about... well, about your parents'
things."
I didn't ask what that meant. I didn't want to know. But I did ask, 'Can we go to the house after? I mean...
my house. The McKay house."
Nancy paused, her smile faltering for just a second. Then she nodded. 'Of course, sweetheart. We can go
there later if you'd like."
I felt a little better after that. The thought of going back to the house—even if it wasn't the same—made the
day seem less overwhelming.
The first place we went to was a building downtown. It was one of those places with glass walls and a lobby
so big it echoed. A man in a suit met us at the door and shook Nancy's hand. He glanced at me and smiled, but
it didn't reach his eyes.
'This must be Layla," he said. 'I'm so sorry for your loss."
I looked down at my shoes. I hated when people said that.
We followed him into a room with a long table and more paperwork. Nancy sat down and started talking to
the man in a low voice. I sat in the chair next to her, my feet dangling above the floor. The room smelled like
coffee and old books.
I tried to listen to what they were saying, but the words blurred together. 'Assets," 'trust fund," 'company
shares." None of it made sense. I didn't know why they kept talking about me. My name came up a lot, but no
one ever explained why.
At one point, the man slid a piece of paper toward Nancy and handed her a pen. 'This is the final
document," he said. 'Once you sign here, everything will be transferred to Layla's name."
Nancy nodded and signed the paper without hesitation. I wanted to ask what she was signing, but I didn't. I
just sat there, swinging my legs and staring at the clock on the wall.
The meeting went on forever. When it was finally over, the man shook Nancy's hand again and said
something about 'taking care of everything." Nancy thanked him and led me out of the room.
As we walked back to the car, I finally worked up the courage to ask, 'What was that about?"
Nancy hesitated, then smiled gently. 'It's just some grown-up stuff, sweetheart. Your parents wanted to
make sure you were taken care of, so they left some things for you. I'm just helping sort it all out."
I didn't know what that meant, but I didn't ask any more questions. Grown-up stuff was always so
confusing, and I didn't think I'd understand even if Nancy explained it.
We got in the car, and Nancy started the engine. The radio crackled to life, playing another old song. Nancy
hummed along as she pulled out of the parking lot.
'One more stop, and then we're done for the day," she said. 'After that, we can go to the house if you still
want to."
I nodded, leaning my head against the window. The thought of going back to the house made my chest
ache, but it was a good ache. Like seeing an old friend after a long time.
I wondered if it would still smell like coffee and printer ink. I wondered if my sandbox was still there, or if
the rain had washed it away. I wondered if Mom's computer was still on, waiting for her to finish her work.
The radio played softly in the background as we drove, and for the first time in days, I felt a little less alone.
By the time we finished the last meeting, I was so tired I could barely keep my eyes open. The day had been
a blur of suits, paperwork, and hushed conversations I didn't understand. My head felt heavy, and my legs
ached from sitting in too many chairs that were too big for me.
Nancy must have noticed because she put a hand on my shoulder as we walked to the car. 'You look worn
out, sweetheart. Let's get you home and into bed."
I nodded, too tired to argue. The thought of going to the McKay house had been the only thing keeping me
going, but now even that felt like too much. All I wanted was to crawl under the quilt and close my eyes.
When we got back to Nancy's house, she made me a cup of tea and helped me get ready for bed. I changed
into my pajamas—a pair of soft flannel ones Nancy had bought for me—and climbed under the covers. The quilt
smelled like lavender, and for once, I didn't mind.
Nancy sat on the edge of the bed and brushed a strand of hair out of my face. 'Get some rest, Layla. You've
had a long day."
I nodded, my eyes already closing. 'Nancy?"
'Yes, sweetheart?"
'Can you... can you get my laptop from the house? And some clothes? I don't want to wear someone else's
stuff forever."
Nancy's expression softened, and she nodded. 'Of course, I can. I'll go tonight. You just focus on sleeping,
okay?"
I nodded again, my eyelids too heavy to keep open. I heard Nancy turn off the lamp and tiptoe out of the
room, closing the door softly behind her.
I didn't know how long I slept, but when I woke up, the house was quiet. The faint glow of the streetlight
outside filtered through the curtains, casting shadows on the walls. I sat up, my heart pounding. For a moment,
I thought I heard Mom's voice, calling me from the kitchen. But it was just the wind, rattling the window.
I lay back down, pulling the quilt up to my chin. The house felt too big, too empty. I missed the sound of
Mom typing, the hum of Dad's tools in the garage. I missed the way they'd laugh together, their voices blending
into something warm and familiar.
I closed my eyes, trying to remember the last time I'd seen them. It was the morning of the accident. Mom
had been at the kitchen table, her laptop open, her fingers flying across the keys. Dad had been in the garage,
tinkering with one of his projects. I'd been in the sandbox, building a castle and pretending I was an engineer,
just like him.
I wished I'd stayed there, in the sandbox, where everything was safe and simple. I wished I'd never gone
inside, never heard the phone ring, never seen Nancy's face when she told me what had happened.
But I couldn't go back. No matter how much I wanted to, I couldn't go back.
I rolled over, burying my face in the pillow. The tears came then, hot and silent. I didn't want to cry. I didn't
want to feel anything. But the ache in my chest was too much, and I couldn't hold it in anymore.
I don't know how long I cried, but eventually, the tears stopped. I lay there, staring at the ceiling, my mind
racing. I didn't want to be here. I didn't want to be anywhere. I just wanted my parents back.
But they weren't coming back. And I didn't know what to do.
