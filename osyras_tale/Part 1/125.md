# Chapter 25 - Morbid Fixation

The Archives and Sanitization department was the facility's circulatory system, but for waste. It was a vast, subterranean level where data went to be catalogued and forgotten, and where physical evidence was sterilized into oblivion. The air was a layered cocktail of scents: the dry, static smell of overheated server racks, the ancient, dusty odor of decaying paper, and beneath it all, the faint, acrid promise of the incinerator chute that ran through the department like an artery.

My new 'station" was a small, isolated carrel tucked between a bank of humming data-servers and towering shelves of physical files. My duties, as outlined by a bored supervisor, were monotonously simple: review digitized reports of 'anomalous biological events" on my terminal, tag them with the appropriate metadata for storage, and occasionally, be tasked with the physical consignment of their paper counterparts to the incinerator. It was work designed to numb the mind, to reinforce my new status as a cog in the machine's most insignificant gear.

Elias, who had used the serum on me, couldn't have devised a better punishment. Or a more perfect hunting ground.

The first few days were a study in profound boredom, punctuated by the humiliating interruptions. Every few hours, the pneumatic hiss of the department's main doors would signal an arrival.

'Renaya." A junior tech would approach my carrel, avoiding my eyes, and drop a stack of bound reports on the corner of the desk. 'These are cleared for destruction. Incinerator run. Log it when you're done."

Or, 'The Director's office requires the physical manifests for Project Aether, cycles 5 through 8. They're in long-term storage, Bay 4. Retrieve and deliver them to sub-level 4."

Each interruption was a reminder of my place. I was the errand girl. The janitor. I would stand, my new body moving with a silent, powerful grace that made the techs subtly tense, and fulfill the request. I would wheel the trolley to the incinerator chute, feed the documents into the glowing maw, and watch the work of someone's life turn to ash. Or I would navigate the canyon-like aisles of long-term storage, retrieving physical artifacts of research that had once been my world.

But in the quiet stretches between these interruptions, I read. And what I read on the flickering terminal was not the work of a broken mind. It was the work of a predator beginning to understand its new ecology.

The reports were a catalog of the bizarre and the unexplained. Farmers in the outer sectors reporting livestock drained of blood, with no signs of struggle or puncture wounds. Deep-space sensor logs from freighters detailing fast-moving biological signatures that broke known physics. Security footage from a mining colony showing a blur of motion in a dark corridor, followed by two guards found hours later, unharmed but with no memory of the entire shift.

At first, I processed them with the methodical, plodding pace my altered cognition demanded. Tag: Unconfirmed Sighting. Tag: Mass Hysteria. Tag: Sensor Malfunction. But patterns began to emerge, patterns my old self would have dismissed as coincidence but that my new instincts recognized as kinship.

A pattern of stillness. A pattern of forgetting.

The reports shared common threads. Witnesses described a sense of profound calm before an event. They reported lapses in time, moments of blankness. Predators that didn't just hunt, but mesmerized. Creatures that operated not on brute force, but on a terrifying, pacifying influence.

My Fugue Effect.

The hot, sharp anger that had flared in the conference room now settled into a cold, simmering understanding. Elias was wrong. The serum he had used on me hadn't created a flaw; it had activated a latent, terrifying blueprint. He was so focused on the quantifiable—the strength, the speed—that he was blind to the subtler, more terrifying weapon. The ability to not just attack the body, but to switch off the mind of the prey.

The pneumatic door hissed open. I didn't look up, my focus on a particularly compelling report from a jungle world describing a native predator that emitted a scent causing its prey to become docile and approach it.

'Renaya." It was the same junior tech. 'Xenobiology needs these outdated specimen logs cross-referenced on the terminal and then the physical copies incinerated. Priority one."

'Acknowledged," I said, my voice a low murmur that didn't seem to startle him as much as it used to. I took the stack of files and placed them to the side, returning to my screen.

He lingered for a moment. 'They, uh, said it was priority."

I turned my head slowly and looked at him. Not with anger, or impatience. Just a look. A stillness settled over him. His urgency faded, replaced by a placid confusion. He blinked, looked at the files on my desk, and then back at the main aisle.

'I'll... come back later," he mumbled, and walked away, his original purpose seemingly forgotten.

A slow smile touched my lips. It was not a human smile. It was an experiment that had yielded perfect results. Control was not about force. It was about suggestion. About creating a silence in the mind of another.

I returned to the terminal, the hum of the servers and the smell of dust my chorus. Each report, each strange sighting, was another piece of a map. A map of my own kind? Or simply a map of a biological principle that evolution had stumbled upon before, and that Elias's serum had now perfected in me?

Later, another interruption. 'Archivist Renaya," a more senior voice called. I was an 'archivist" now. The promotion was meaningless. 'This entire shelf in Bay 7 has been decommissioned. The data is already purged from the system. Box it all up for incineration."

I stood and took the heavy trolley. The senior tech watched me, expecting a struggle. I loaded the boxes filled with the weight of discarded science with ease. The journey to the incinerator room was long, through corridors lined with identical, numbered storage bays.

The incinerator room was hot, the air vibrating with the constant, low roar of the furnace. I began the mindless task of feeding the past into the fire. My mind was elsewhere, turning over the day's discoveries.

As I slid a final box toward the chute, my enhanced hearing caught a sound from the access corridor behind me. Not the roar of the fire or the sigh of ventilation, but something else. A soft, rhythmic scrape against the gridded metal floor. Then a low, guttural click.

I went perfectly still, my breathing slowing, my senses stretching into the gloom of the corridor. The air here was hot and ashy, but beneath that, something else. A faint, coppery tang. The scent of ozone, sharp and electric.

The scraping sound came again, closer this time. It was followed by a whisper of movement, something large shifting in the shadows of a nearby accessway. It wasn't human.

A thrill that was neither fear nor excitement, but something primal and new, shot through me. The facility's secrets were not all digitized and buried in a server. Some of them were living down here, in the hot, dark places.

The lights in the corridor flickered and died, plunging it into darkness. The scraping stopped. Silence descended, thick and heavy, broken only by the hungry roar of the incinerator.

I wasn't alone. And whatever was in the darkness with me knew I was here.

The hunt, it seemed, had come to me.
