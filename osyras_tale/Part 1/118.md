# Chapter 18 - Ship Shape

The bank's heavy glass door swung shut behind Layla with a hushed whoosh, sealing out the city noise. Her  
sneakers squeaked on the polished marble floor as she marched straight to the nearest teller, fingers drumming  
the counter.  
"I need to access my father's safety deposit box. Eric McKay's account. And I'll be closing it today."  
The teller blinked at the petite young woman dwarfed by her oversized hoodie. "Do you have—"  
"Authorization documents, keys, and two forms of ID right here." Layla slapped a folder on the counter,  
already flipping it open to reveal precisely ordered paperwork. Behind her, Vanity stood motionless, violet eyes  
flicking over the bank's security cameras.  
A throat cleared behind them. "Layla McKay?" An elderly man with a spectacular white mustache emerged  
from an office. "My goodness, look at you." Mr. Henderson's eyes crinkled with warmth. "Last time I saw you,  
you needed a step stool to see over this counter."  
Layla's rigid posture softened slightly. "You still keep lollipops in your desk?"  
"For my favorite clients? Always." He gestured toward the vault. "Shall we?"  
The safety deposit box contained only one item: a plain white cardboard box, roughly the size of a shoebox,  
sealed with anti-tamper tape stamped DO NOT OPEN BEFORE 10/17.  
Layla turned it over in her hands. It was definitely passed that date.  
"That's it?" She peered into the empty metal drawer.  
Mr. Henderson shrugged. "That's all there ever was. Your dad brought this in five years ago with very  
specific instructions." He tapped the date stamp. "It seems like now is a good time to mail out this box." he  
hesitated then added, "Oh I almost forgot." He goes to his desk and pulls out a cherry lollipop. "This is for you,  
Layla."  
"Mr. Henderson, I'm and adult now, not a child." she says as she accepts the lollipop. "Thank you for your  
help." She turns to leave.  
Back in the parking lot, rain pattered against the Smart Car's roof as Layla examined the box under the  
dome light. "Site 17?" She traced the destination address with her pinky. "Where the hell is that?"  
Vanity attempted to scan through the cardboard. "It's just a bunch of paper documents. I can't read them  
though."  
Layla shake the box gently to show Vanity that scanning was unnecessary. "It's just papers. What can you  
tell me about Site 17?"  
"I have never heard of it before," Vanity said, her eyes flickering. "Maybe it is a military base or  
something?"  
Layla grabbed a pen from the glove compartment and scratched out the return address—her childhood  
home—replacing it with Nancy's. "Let's just mail this thing."  
With that, she ripped open the lollipop wrapper and shoved the candy into her mouth, the artificial cherry  
sweetness clashing with the bitterness coiled in her chest. The crinkling cellophane joined the rain's static as  
she twisted the key in the ignition. The engine sputtered to life.  
Vanity watched in silence as Layla chewed down on the stick, her jaw working like she was grinding an old  
grievance into dust.
