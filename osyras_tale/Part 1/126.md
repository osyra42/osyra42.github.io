# Chapter 26 - It burns Anything

The world narrowed to the space between the incinerator’s roar and the silence in the dark corridor. My body, still holding a box of files, was a statue. Every sense stretched out, parsing the information flooding in.

The coppery scent was stronger now. It wasn't just ozone. It was the smell of a hot engine, of charged ions, and beneath it, something organic. Musk. Dried blood. The scraping sound had been replaced by a low, resonant hum, like a power cell on the verge of overloading.

My eyes, better suited to the gloom than any human’s, adjusted. The darkness in the accessway was not absolute. It was stirred by a faint, shimmering distortion, a heat-haze that moved against the still air.

A shape coalesced from the distortion. It was large, easily the size of a human, but its form was wrong. It seemed to be all limbs, too many of them, articulated in ways that made my own altered spine seem mundane. It moved with a stuttering, insectile grace, each step a silent placement of a clawed appendage on the metal gridding. Its skin—or hide—was a mottled, dark grey that drank the light, and it pulsed with the same slow, rhythmic hum I could feel through the floor. Its head was a nightmare of sensory organs: clusters of black, pit-like eyes and quivering, wire-thin antennae that twitched in my direction.

It was a thing of the vents, the ducts, the forgotten spaces. A cleaner of a different sort.

It took another step into the incinerator room, its multitude of eyes fixing on me. There was no curiosity, only a cold, operational hostility. I was an intruder.

I let the fugue state roll off me, a wave of pacifying energy. The air thickened, humming with forced calm.

The creature hesitated. Its aggressive hum faltered. For a glorious second, its limbs slowed, its head tilting in confusion. The spell was taking hold.

Then, a sharp, angry click erupted from its maw. Its antennae vibrated violently, as if shaking off the effect. The creature’s eyes snapped back into focus, blazing with a new, incandescent rage. My power had failed. It had only pissed it off.

The fight began not with a roar, but with a silent, blinding lunge.

It crossed the distance in a scuttling blur, a hooked claw scything toward my head. My body reacted before my mind could process it. I dropped into a crouch, the claw whistling over me and gouging a deep furrow in the server bank behind me with a shriek of tearing metal.

Adrenaline—or whatever now fueled me—flooded my system. The world sharpened into hyper-clarity. The incinerator’s roar faded to a distant whisper. There was only the opponent.

I came up from the crouch inside its guard, driving a fist into its thorax. The impact was like punching a slab of reinforced concrete. A shock of pain jolted up my arm, but the creature grunted, skittering back a step. It was strong. Incredibly strong.

It recovered instantly, lashing out with two smaller, needle-sharp forelimbs. I twisted, but one grazed my side, slicing through the cheap archival uniform and drawing a line of fire across my ribs. The pain was clean, sharp. A stimulant.

We broke apart for a heartbeat, circling in the hot, cramped space. It was faster than me, its multiple limbs giving it terrifying agility. But I was stronger, my stance rooted and powerful. I could feel the deep, immense strength in me, waiting to be unleashed.

It lunged again, a feint with one claw followed by a vicious stab with a needle-limb toward my throat. This time, I didn’t dodge. I caught the striking limb mid-thrust. My hand closed around the chitinous appendage, and with a grunt of effort, I twisted.

There was a wet, cracking sound. The creature shrieked, a high-frequency sound of pure agony that cut through the incinerator’s din. I wrenched harder, pulling it off-balance, and drove my other fist into the cluster of its eyes.

Black, viscous fluid splattered my fist and face. The creature reeled back, blind and shrieking, flailing wildly. It was berserk, dangerous. A blind swing of a primary claw caught me in the chest and threw me backward. I slammed into the incinerator control panel, the metal buckling under the impact. Alarms blared, adding to the cacophony.

Gasping for air, I pushed myself up. The creature was thrashing, destroying everything around it. I had to end this. Now.

I pushed off the wall, charging low under its wild swings. I tackled it around its midsection, driving it back toward the open incinerator chute. The heat was immense, blistering. The creature’s claws scrabbled at my back, tearing deep gouges, but my grip was iron.

With a final, roaring effort, I lifted the squirming, shrieking horror and shoved it into the glowing maw of the incinerator.

For a moment, it clung to the edge, one claw hooked on the rim. Its horrific, shattered face turned to me, and it let out one last, guttural click. Then, the intense heat did its work. The claw glowed red, then white, and snapped. The creature vanished into the inferno with a final, silent scream that was swallowed by the flames.

Silence descended, broken only by the blaring alarm and the hungry roar of the fire.

I stood there, chest heaving, blood and black ichor dripping from my wounds. The gashes on my back and side burned, but even as I watched, the flow of blood was already slowing, the flesh beginning to knit together with a faint, itching heat. Another feature. Rapid regeneration.

I looked at the destruction. Scorched walls, torn metal, the spilled box of files now smeared with evidence of the fight. They would know.

A slow, grim smile spread across my face. Let them know.

The hunt was no longer theoretical. I had been tested against another of this facility’s nightmares, and I had won. My fugue state was a scalpel, but my body was a hammer. And sometimes, a hammer was exactly what was needed.

Elias had tried to bury me in the past. Instead, he had thrown me into the arena. And I had just drawn first blood.

The archives were not a library. They were an armory. And I had just found my first weapon.
