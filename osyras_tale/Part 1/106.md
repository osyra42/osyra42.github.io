# Chapter 06 – A Promise

It had been three years since Nala McKay volunteered to go on a Christian missionary trip to a foreign
country. She was 18 years old at the time, fresh out of high school and full of hope—not the naive kind that
ignores the world's problems, but the kind that believes in solutions. The kind that believes in people.
The mission was simple on paper: help bring clean drinking water to a remote village, teach basic medicine,
and share Scriptures from the Bible. But to Nala, it was more than that. It was a chance to live out her faith in a
tangible way—to be hands and feet in a world that often felt broken. She didn't see it as an escape. She saw it as
a calling. A different path. One that felt right in a way nothing else ever had.
Her parents had other plans for her. Alissa and Eric McKay ran a successful tech business—McKay
Innovations—and they'd always assumed Nala would join them after high school. Alissa was the brains behind
the software, a programming genius who could turn lines of code into something revolutionary. Eric was the
engineer, the one who brought her ideas to life with blueprints and prototypes. Together, they were
unstoppable. And they wanted Nala to be part of it.
'You've got your mom's creativity and your dad's problem-solving skills," Alissa would say, her eyes
sparkling with pride. 'You'd be perfect for the business."
But Nala didn't see herself in their world. She loved them, and she admired what they'd built, but she didn't
want to spend her life in an office, designing software or drafting blueprints. She wanted to be out there,
helping people directly. She wanted to see the impact of her work in the smiles on people's faces, in the lives
that were changed because of it.
The more they pushed, the more Nala tried to explain. 'It's not that I don't appreciate what you've built,"
she told them one evening over dinner. 'It's just... I feel like I'm being called to something else. Something that
feels like me."
Eric frowned, his engineer's mind struggling to understand. 'But this is your legacy, Nala. This is where you
belong."
'Maybe," Nala said gently. 'But maybe my legacy is something different. Something I need to find for
myself."
They didn't get it. How could they? To them, the business was everything. To Nala, it was just one path
among many. And she was choosing a different one.
That's when Nala started going to church with Nancy Mitts. Nancy had been a family friend for as long as
Nala could remember, and she'd always been a source of comfort and wisdom. Where Nala's parents saw the
world in terms of logic and systems, Nancy saw it in terms of people and relationships. She had a way of
making you feel seen, of reminding you that you mattered.
One Sunday, after another tense conversation with her parents about her future, Nala showed up at Nancy's
door. Nancy didn't ask questions—just handed her a cup of tea and sat with her in silence until Nala was ready
to talk.
'I don't know how to make them understand," Nala admitted, her voice soft but steady. 'I don't want to
disappoint them, but I can't keep pretending to be someone I'm not."
Nancy smiled gently. 'Sometimes, the hardest thing is staying true to yourself when the people you love
want something different for you. But that doesn't mean you're wrong. It just means you're brave."
That's when Nancy told Nala about the missionary trip. A group from her church was organizing a team to
travel to a remote village and help bring clean water, teach basic medicine, and share the Gospel. It was a sixmonth commitment, with the possibility of extending to a year or more.
'It's not an easy life," Nancy warned. 'But it's a meaningful one. And I think it might be exactly what you're
looking for."
Nala signed up that same day, her heart full of hope. When she told her parents, they were... supportive, in
their own way. Alissa hugged her and said she was proud of her, though Nala could see the worry in her eyes.
Eric gave her one of his rare smiles and said, 'Just don't forget where you came from, Nala."
Nala didn't know what to say to that. Forget where she came from? That was the last thing she wanted to
do. She just wanted to honor it in her own way.
The Phone Call
Now, three years later, Nala sat on the edge of a cot in a different village, staring at her phone. The screen lit
up with a name she hadn't seen in months: Nancy Mitts. Her heart skipped a beat. Nancy never called unless it
was important.
She answered, her voice hesitant. 'Hello?"
'Nala," Nancy said, and Nala could hear the tremor in her voice. 'It's Nancy. I... I need to talk to you. It's
about your parents."
The world tilted. Nala's grip on the phone tightened. 'What happened?"
There was a pause on the other end of the line, and Nala could hear Nancy take a shaky breath. 'There was
an accident, Nala. A car crash. Your parents... they didn't make it."
The words hit Nala like a punch to the chest. She couldn't breathe. She couldn't think. All she could do was
sit there, the phone pressed to her ear, as the world around her dissolved into a blur.
'Nala?" Nancy's voice was soft, tentative. 'Are you still there?"
Nala swallowed hard, forcing herself to speak. 'I'm here."
'I'm so sorry, sweetheart," Nancy said, her voice breaking. 'I know how much they meant to you."
Nala closed her eyes, and suddenly, she was back home. Back in the kitchen, where Alissa would sit at the
table with her laptop, her smooth black hair pulled into a loose bun, her fingers flying across the keyboard as
she worked. She'd hum under her breath, some old hymn or a song she'd heard on the radio, and every now
and then, she'd look up and smile at Nala. 'What do you think, bug?" she'd ask, and Nala would pretend to
understand whatever she was working on, just to see her eyes light up.
And Eric... Eric would be in the garage, bent over his workbench, a pencil tucked behind his ear. He'd let
Nala sit next to him, handing her tools and explaining what he was doing in that calm, steady voice of his. 'See
this, Nala?" he'd say, pointing to a blueprint. 'This is how we make the world better. One piece at a time."
They weren't perfect, but they were hers. Alissa, with her sharp mind and quick laugh, was the kind of
person who could light up a room just by walking into it. She was brilliant—there was no other word for it. She
could look at a problem and see solutions no one else could, like she had a direct line to some higher logic. But
what Nala loved most about her was her heart. She cared deeply, even if she didn't always know how to show it.
She'd stay up late with Nala when she was sick, her fingers flying across her laptop keyboard as she worked,
pausing only to check Nala's temperature or bring her a glass of water. She wasn't always soft, but she was
always there.
Eric was different. Quiet, steady, and endlessly patient. He was the kind of man who could fix anything—a
leaky faucet, a broken toy, a shattered heart. He didn't say much, but when he did, you listened. He had this
way of making you feel safe, like no matter how bad things got, he'd figure out a way to make them better. He
was Nala's rock, even when she didn't realize she needed one.
They loved her. She never doubted that. But they loved her in their own way—through expectations,
through plans, through the future they'd mapped out for her. And Nala loved them too, even when their love
felt like a weight she couldn't carry. She didn't want to hurt them. She just wanted to be herself.
'Nala?" Nancy's voice pulled her back to the present. 'Are you okay?"
Nala opened her eyes, and the tears came. 'No," she whispered. 'I'm not okay."
There was a long silence on the other end of the line, and then Nala spoke again, her voice trembling but
firm. 'Nancy... I need to come home. I need to be there. For them. For me."
Nancy's voice softened with relief. 'I think that's the right decision, Nala. Your parents would want you to
be there."
'I'll start making arrangements right away," Nala said, already mentally packing her things. 'I'll be there as
soon as I can."
'Good," Nancy said, her voice warm with gratitude. 'I'll take care of everything on this end. Just... get here
safely, okay?"
'I will," Nala promised. 'Thank you, Nancy."
She hung up the phone and sat there for a long moment, her mind racing. Her parents were gone. The
people who raised her, who loved her, who shaped her into the person she was—they were gone. And she... she
needed to go home.
Nala stood up, her legs shaky beneath her, and began packing her things. The village, the mission, the life
she'd built here—it all felt so far away now. Her heart ached for the people she'd come to love, but she knew
where she was needed most.
As she folded her clothes and gathered her belongings, she thought about her parents. About the life they'd
built, the love they'd shared, the legacy they'd left behind. She didn't know what awaited her at home, but she
knew she needed to be there. For them. For herself.
Nala took a deep breath and whispered a prayer. 'God, give me the strength to do this. For my parents. For
me."
And with that, she began the long journey home.
