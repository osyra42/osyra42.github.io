# Chapter 28 - Mercenary

The transition was jarring. One day, the world was the hum of servers and the smell of dust. The next, it was the percussive thunder of gunfire and the coppery tang of adrenaline.

Kael's operation was housed in a nondescript, privately-owned industrial complex on the fringes of the capital. It was a world of raw concrete, echoing hangars, and state-of-the-art training modules that felt a universe away from the sterile, bureaucratic hell of Elias's facility. Here, there were no observers behind plasteel, no careful notations on a datapad. Here, there was only performance.

My trainers were introduced without ceremony. Vance, a grizzled veteran with a cybernetic eye and a handshake that could crush stone, was responsible for weapons and tactics. Sorra, a woman whose lean frame was pure, coiled muscle and whose movements were a silent language of violence, would handle close-quarters combat.

'The briefing is simple," Vance grunted on my first morning, handing me a standard-issue military pulse rifle. It felt like a toy in my hands. 'You're strong. We know. But strength without control is just noise. You need to be a scalpel. Now. Field strip it."

My old self would have balked at the complex machinery. My new, simpler mind absorbed the task with a different kind of efficiency. I didn't understand the physics of the plasma coil, but my fingers, guided by a deep, instinctual kinesthetic intelligence, found the release catches, the power conduit, the barrel housing. I had it disassembled on the table in under ten seconds.

Vance's cybernetic eye whirred softly. 'Hmph. Again. Faster."

And so it began. The montage was a brutal, beautiful symphony of controlled violence.

Strength and Speed: They started by testing my limits, and quickly gave up. Weightlifting was a joke. The crushing grip of hydraulic machines meant to simulate enemy strength I could overcome with casual effort. Instead, Sorra focused on application. She taught me to channel the immense, deep-well power into precise, devastating strikes. A punch wasn't just about throwing my weight; it was about torque, alignment, and transferring force through a target's center of mass. I learned to shatter reinforced training dummies with a single, whip-crack blow from my fist, my foot, even my tail—a weapon that took even the unflappable Sorra by surprise with its speed and power.

Hand-to-Hand: Sparring with Sorra was like fighting a ghost. She was faster, technically perfect. At first, she danced around me, landing stinging blows on my ribs, my jaw. But I learned. My body learned. I began to predict the patterns of combat, my enhanced reflexes reading the micro-tensions in her muscles before she even moved. Within a week, I was no longer just absorbing hits. I was countering. I caught her kick one session, my hand closing around her ankle like a vice. I didn't shove her back; I used her own momentum to swing her off her feet and onto the mats with a controlled thud that shook the room. For the first time, I saw a flicker of respect in her eyes, not for my strength, but for my control.

Weapons: Vance stopped treating me like a rookie. He brought out the specialized hardware. High-caliber sniper rifles that would dislocate a normal person's shoulder; I fired them standing, the recoil a gentle nudge. Heavy, rotary-fed plasma cannons that required a harness; I used them from the hip, my body a perfectly stable platform. Accuracy wasn't a learned skill; it was a function of my preternatural stillness. I could hold my breath for minutes, my heartbeat a slow, steady drum that never disturbed my aim. I could calculate windage and drop not with a computer, but with an innate, predatory understanding of physics and environment.

The Fugue: This was the variable they couldn't control, only anticipate. "The reports are clear,"Kael said, watching me during a high-intensity stress drill. "It's an involuntary pheromonal response to extreme duress. You don't turn it on. It leaks out. Our job is to make sure that when it does, it's in an environment where we can capitalize on the chaos."

The drill was designed to induce that exact stress. Live fire zipped past me—non-lethal rounds, but they stung like hell. Alarms blared. Strobe lights flashed. Two of Sorra's best close-quarters specialists hunted me through the mock urban environment, their goal to subdue me.

I was pushing my body to its limits, ducking, weaving, and returning fire. The adrenaline was a fire in my veins. And then, as a specialist cornered me, his weapon raised, the wave of pure fight-or-flight panic crested.

I felt it happen. The air around me grew heavy, humming with an unseen charge. My sweat carried the chemical trigger.

The specialist didn't freeze. His aggression simply... dissolved. His weapon arm went slack. His eyes glazed over, losing all intent, staring past me with a look of placid confusion. He stood there, mesmerized and docile, a perfect target.

I disarmed him with a simple twist of his wrist and moved on, my heart hammering. The effect lasted only a few seconds before he shook his head, blinking in utter bewilderment at his empty hands.

Later, debriefing in the observation room, Vance pointed at the frozen feed. "See that? You didn't beat him with speed or strength. You short-circuited his will to fight. It's a biological smoke bomb. Uncontrollable, unpredictable, but if we can learn to predict the conditions that trigger it, we can use it."

Sorra nodded. "The trick won't be using it. The trick will be staying functional yourself when it happens. You lose focus, too. It's a wave that knocks everyone down, you just recover faster."

Their strategy changed. They couldn't train me to use the fugue; they trained me to survive it. They ran me through exhausting gauntlets until the fugue state triggered, then drilled me on maintaining my own operational awareness through the mental fog. They taught me to recognize the building pressure in my own chest, the precursor to the release, so I could at least anticipate the moment my most dangerous weapon would fire blindly.

It was frustrating. It was the one part of me that remained truly wild, a remnant of the trauma Elias had inflicted. But Kael's team didn't see a flaw. They saw a unique and potent asset. Even an unpredictable weapon has its uses, if you're clever enough to point it in the right direction before it goes off.

For the first time since the serum, I was not hiding. I was not restraining myself. I was being forged. The dull, pudding-like boredom of the archives was burned away in the fire of constant, demanding exertion. My body, which had felt like a cage, became an instrument of terrifying precision. My mind, though simpler, was razor-sharp in its focus on the immediate, the tactical, the now.

I was not becoming a soldier. I was becoming something more. Something the special forces operators who sometimes trained in the far bays would watch with a mixture of awe and primal fear.

I was becoming the solution Kael had promised. A hunter, honed to a perfect, lethal edge. And I was finally, gloriously, awake.
