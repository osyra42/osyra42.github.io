# Chapter 27 - Pudding Brain

Time in the archives congealed. Days bled into weeks, weeks into months, each one indistinguishable from the last. My world was a silent, dusty orbit between the humming server banks, the endless shelves, and the roaring incinerator. My mind, once a scalpel of brilliant intuition, had been reduced to a blunt instrument by the serum, and now the soul-crushing monotony was turning it to pudding. I tagged reports. I fetched files. I incinerated the past. I was a ghost in the machine's gut, and I felt myself fading, my new, potent body trapped in a cage of utter irrelevance.

The fight with the vent creature had been a fleeting, violent spark in the gloom. After a frantic, hushed-up cleanup by a terrified maintenance crew who asked no questions, everything returned to the same stifling routine. It was as if the incident had never happened. I was just the broken archivist, the failed experiment, forgotten by all but the system that demanded my meaningless labor.

Then, the summons came.

It wasn't through the usual channels. No bored tech arrived at my carrel. Instead, the direct line on my terminal—a line I had never seen used—flashed with a priority-one alert. The message was simple: Report to Surface Reception. Immediate.

Surface Reception. The front lobby. Where visitors from the outside world came. A place I hadn't seen since before the serum. A place that had no reason to want me.

A flicker of something—not hope, something harder and more wary—stirred in my chest. I stood, my body uncoiling from the sedentary posture with its usual silent power, and made my way through the labyrinthine sub-levels toward the surface elevators.

The light in the main lobby was jarring. After months of artificial, yellowish gloom, the bright, cool-white illumination was almost painful. The air was different too; not recycled and dusty, but crisp, filtered, and smelling faintly of antiseptic and polished floor wax. People in sharp, clean uniforms moved with purpose, their voices hushed but intent. I stood there for a moment in my simple, worn archival coveralls, feeling like a cave creature dragged into the sun.

'Archivist Renaya?"

A man stepped away from the reception desk. He was not what I expected. He wasn't military, like Corvin, though he carried a similar coiled readiness. He wasn't a scientist, like Elias, though his gaze was just as assessing. He was dressed in practical, dark, civilian attire, a long coat worn not for style but to conceal what I suspected was a formidable array of weaponry. His face was weathered, lined with the evidence of a life spent looking at things others avoided. His eyes, a cool grey, scanned me, and I saw them note the way I stood, the unnatural stillness, the latent strength in my posture. He didn't look confused or repulsed. He looked... interested.

'My name is Kael," he said, his voice a low, gravelly rumble. 'I represent a consortium with certain... interests. We have a problem. And I've been led to believe you might be a unique solution."

He didn't wait for an answer. He gestured toward a small, private consultation room off the main lobby. I followed, my senses on high alert.

Inside, the door hissed shut, muting the sounds of the lobby. Kael got straight to the point.

'We know what you are, Dr. Renaya. Or rather, what you've become. We've seen the reports Elias buries down there. The physical enhancements. The... psychological effect." He leaned forward, his elbows on his knees. 'The things in those reports you file away? They're real. And they're becoming a problem. Not in the outer sectors, not on fringe colonies. Here. Now."

He slid a datapad across the table. On it was a security still. It was blurry, taken in a rain-slicked alley in a city I recognized as the capital's industrial sector. The creature in the image was a mess of shadows and sharp angles, a thing of teeth and claws that defied easy classification. It was exactly the kind of thing I'd been reading about for months.

'Conventional forces are ineffective. They can't find them. Or when they do, they can't remember the engagement. Or they become... docile." His grey eyes locked onto mine. 'Sound familiar?"

He let the question hang in the air.

'We don't need a scientist," he continued. 'We need a hunter. Someone who can track these things. Someone who can stand against them. Someone who can turn their own weapons against them." He gestured vaguely in my direction. 'Your file suggests you are uniquely qualified. Your reassignment here was Elias's failure to see the tool for what it is. We see it."

He laid it out plainly. A job. Not as an archivist. Not as a janitor. But as what I had become. I would hunt. I would fight. I would use the fugue, the strength, the speed—everything Elias had written off as a flaw—as my primary tools. I would be pointed at a target and released.

I looked at the image on the datapad. I saw the creature in the archive, the one I'd incinerated. I saw the thousands of reports of things that stalked and mesmerized and fed. I saw the endless, empty months ahead of me in the fluorescent hell of the archives, my mind turning to mush, my body wasting away in silence.

There was no future here. There was only a past I couldn't return to and a present that was a living death.

Kael was offering a future. A violent, dangerous, terrifying one. But it was a future where I was not broken. I was not a flaw. I was the solution.

I looked up from the datapad and met his gaze. The word was simple. It felt like the first real, decisive thing I'd said in months.

'Yes."
