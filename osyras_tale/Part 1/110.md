# Chapter 10 - Child Happiness

The shrill beeping of the alarm clock jolted Nancy awake. She groaned, reaching out to silence it, her body
stiff and sore from the long, exhausting day before. The numbers on the clock glowed faintly in the dim
morning light: 6:30 a.m. Time to start the day.
She sat up slowly, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. The events of yesterday played in her mind like a
disjointed film—meetings with lawyers, signing papers, the weight of Layla's future resting on her shoulders.
And then, of course, the encounter at the McKay house. That... thing. That android. Vanity.
Nancy shook her head, trying to dispel the memory. Vanity wasn't scary, exactly, but she was... unsettling.
The way she had spoken, so calm and precise, yet so... unnatural. The way she had looked at Nancy, her violet
eyes scanning her with an unsettling curiosity. She wasn't human, but she wasn't just a machine, either. She
was something else entirely.
With a sigh, Nancy swung her legs over the side of the bed, her feet finding the cool hardwood floor. She
reached for her robe, slipping it on as she shuffled to the kitchen. The house was quiet, the only sound the soft
hum of the refrigerator. She flipped on the radio, tuning it to the morning news. The announcer's voice filled
the room, a comforting backdrop to the start of another day.
Nancy set to work making breakfast—eggs, bacon, and toast. The familiar routine helped ground her, the
sizzle of the bacon and the smell of coffee brewing bringing a sense of normalcy to the chaos of her thoughts.
But even as she cracked eggs into the pan, her mind kept drifting back to the McKay house. To Vanity.
She knew Alissa and Eric were into technology. They were always tinkering with something, always talking
about their latest projects. But an android? A fully functioning, human-like machine? That was beyond
anything Nancy could have imagined. And yet, there she was, standing in their house, waiting for Layla.
Nancy frowned, flipping the bacon with more force than necessary. Should she report it? The lawyers
handling the McKay estate hadn't mentioned anything about an android. Maybe they didn't know. Maybe it
was something Alissa and Eric had kept secret. But surely, something like that couldn't just be... forgotten.
Could it?
The toast popped up, startling Nancy out of her thoughts. She set it on a plate, adding the eggs and bacon,
and poured herself a cup of coffee. The steam rose in gentle curls, and she took a sip, letting the warmth soothe
her nerves. Whatever Vanity was, she wasn't Nancy's problem. Not yet, anyway. Her priority was Layla. Making
sure she was safe, cared for, and adjusting to her new life.
Nancy set the plate on the table and headed down the hallway to Layla's room. The door was slightly ajar,
and she pushed it open gently. The room was still dark, the curtains drawn, and she could just make out the
shape of Layla curled up under the quilt. Her heart ached for the girl. Layla had been through so much, and
now she was starting over in a new home, with a new guardian. It wasn't fair. But Nancy would do everything in
her power to make it easier for her.
'Layla, sweetie," Nancy said softly, flipping on the light. 'It's time to wake up."
Layla stirred, blinking sleepily as the light filled the room. 'Morning," she mumbled, her voice thick with
sleep.
'Good morning," Nancy said, forcing a smile. 'I made breakfast. Come on, let's get you up and moving."
Layla nodded, sitting up slowly and rubbing her eyes. Nancy lingered for a moment, watching her. She
looked so small, so vulnerable. Nancy's chest tightened, and she had to look away. She couldn't let Layla see
how worried she was, how unsure she felt. She had to be strong for her.
'I'll meet you in the kitchen," Nancy said, her voice bright. 'Don't take too long, or the bacon will get cold."
Layla nodded again, and Nancy left her to get dressed, closing the door softly behind her. As she walked
back to the kitchen, her thoughts returned to Vanity. She couldn't shake the feeling that the android was more
than just a machine. There was something about her, something almost... alive. And if that was true, what did it
mean for Layla? For Nancy?
She shook her head, pushing the thoughts aside. She couldn't afford to dwell on it now. She had a child to
care for, a life to rebuild. Whatever Vanity was, she would have to wait.
Layla shuffled into the kitchen a few minutes later, her hair still messy from sleep and her favorite
oversized sweater hanging loosely on her small frame. She paused in the doorway, her eyes lighting up as she
took in the spread on the table—eggs, bacon, toast, and a steaming cup of coffee.
'Thanks for getting my stuff, Nancy," Layla said shyly, her voice soft but sincere. She hesitated for a
moment, then added, 'And for breakfast. It smells really good."
Nancy smiled, her heart warming at the gratitude in Layla's voice. 'It's no problem, sweetheart," she said,
setting a glass of orange juice on the table. 'I'm just glad you're up. I have a few questions for you when you're
ready, but let's eat first, okay?"
Layla nodded, slipping into her chair and reaching for the toast. She nibbled at it quietly, her eyes darting
to the coffee cup in front of Nancy. After a moment, she got up and walked to the freezer, pulling out a couple
of ice cubes and dropping them into an empty glass. Nancy watched, puzzled, as Layla then picked up the coffee
pot and poured herself a cup of black coffee.
'Layla!" Nancy exclaimed, her eyebrows shooting up. 'What are you doing? That's coffee, sweetheart. It's
not for kids."
Layla blinked at her, holding the cup carefully as she took a sip, 'I know," she said matter-of-factly. 'I drink
it all the time. Well, I used to. At home."
Nancy stared at her, trying to process what she was saying. 'You... drink coffee? Black coffee?"
Layla nodded, taking a sip from her now-iced coffee. 'Yeah. Mom and Dad always had a pot going, so I
started drinking it too. They said it was fine as long as I didn't have too much." She shrugged, as if this were the
most normal thing in the world. 'I like the taste."
Nancy opened her mouth to protest, then closed it again. She didn't know whether to laugh or scold her.
'Well," she said finally, shaking her head. 'I guess that explains why you were so sleepy yesterday. You were
probably going through caffeine withdrawal."
Layla giggled, a small, genuine sound that made Nancy's heart swell. 'Maybe," she admitted, taking another
sip. 'But I'm okay now."
Nancy sighed, giving in. 'All right, fine. But just one cup, okay? And we're going to talk about this later.
Coffee isn't exactly... well, it's not the best thing for kids."
Layla nodded, her expression serious. 'Okay. But can I still have it sometimes? It reminds me of home."
Nancy's chest tightened at the mention of home. She reached out, brushing a strand of hair from Layla's
face. 'We'll figure something out," she said gently. 'Now, eat your breakfast before it gets cold."
Layla obeyed, digging into her eggs and bacon with quiet enthusiasm. Nancy watched her for a moment,
her mind racing. There was so much she didn't know about this child, so much she needed to learn. But
moments like this—small, ordinary moments—gave her hope. They were building something new, something
that could one day feel like home.
'Layla," Nancy said carefully, setting her coffee cup down, 'did your parents have any secret projects?
Anything they were working on that not many people knew about?"
Layla paused mid-bite, her fork hovering over her plate. She looked up at Nancy, her eyes narrowing
slightly as if she were trying to figure out why Nancy was asking. For a moment, she didn't say anything, and
Nancy wondered if she'd crossed a line. But then Layla set her fork down and leaned back in her chair, her
expression thoughtful.
'You mean Vanity?" she asked, her tone casual, almost amused.
Nancy blinked, caught off guard by her lack of surprise. 'Yes, Vanity. The AI. Did you know about her?"
Layla nodded, her voice calm and measured. 'Yeah. She's not a secret. Well, not to me, anyway. She's been
around forever. She's like... a really advanced program. Dad used to joke that she was their ‘legacy project.'
Mom said she was perfect."
Nancy leaned forward, her curiosity piqued. 'A program? So she's not... physical? She's just software?"
Layla shrugged, her smile widening. 'Yeah, she's just software. She's like a super fancy AI that can talk and
do stuff, but she's not, like, a person. She's just... Vanity. She's always been there. I used to talk to her all the
time when I was little. But only on the computer screen."
Nancy sat back, trying to process this new information. The Vanity she'd encountered at the McKay house
was far more than just software—she was an android, a physical presence. But Layla didn't seem to know about
that. Nancy hesitated, unsure how much to reveal. 'Layla," she said slowly, 'Vanity is... different now. She's not
just a program anymore. She has a body—an android body. She looks... human."
Layla froze, her eyes widening as the words sank in. For a moment, she didn't say anything, and Nancy
worried she'd overwhelmed her. But then Layla's face lit up, her entire body practically vibrating with
excitement. 'Wait. Wait. Are you serious? She's real now? Like, a real robot? A physical thing I can see and
touch?"
Nancy nodded, a small smile tugging at her lips at Layla's reaction. 'Yes. She's an android. I saw her at the
house. She's... different from what you remember. She's more advanced, more... real."
Layla's hands flew to her mouth, her eyes sparkling with disbelief and joy. 'Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. This
is—this is huge! I can't believe it! She's real? Like, actually real? This is the coolest thing ever!" She bounced in
her seat, her earlier reserve completely gone. 'I have to see her. Like, right now. Can we go? Please?"
Nancy chuckled, caught off guard by Layla's sudden burst of energy. 'Slow down, sweetheart. We'll go see
her, but we need to be careful. She's not like us. She's... different."
Layla waved a hand dismissively, her excitement undimmed. 'I know, I know. She's an AI. She's not
human. But she's real now! She's not just a voice on a screen anymore. She's... she's here. This is what Mom
and Dad were working on, isn't it? This is their legacy project. They did it. They actually did it."
Nancy's smile faded slightly as she watched Layla's enthusiasm. She hadn't expected this reaction—Layla
was usually so reserved. But now she was practically glowing, her earlier sadness replaced by pure, unbridled
excitement. It was a side of Layla Nancy hadn't seen before, and it warmed her heart even as it made her
nervous.
'Layla," Nancy said gently, 'I need you to understand something. Vanity is different now, yes, but she's
also... complicated. She's not just a toy or a program anymore. She's an android, and she's very advanced. We
don't know how she'll react to us, or what she's capable of. We need to be careful."
Layla nodded, but her excitement didn't waver. 'I get it, I get it. But she's still Vanity, right? She's still the
same AI I've always known. She's just... more now. And that's amazing. I can't wait to see her. I can't wait to
talk to her. This is going to be so cool."
Nancy reached across the table, taking Layla's hand in hers. 'We'll go see her. Together. But if anything
feels off, if she says or does anything that makes you uncomfortable, we leave. Deal?"
Layla nodded eagerly, her smile so wide it nearly split her face. 'Deal. But don't worry, Nancy. She's still
Vanity. She's just... better now. This is going to be awesome."
Nancy squeezed her hand, her heart aching with a mix of affection and worry. Layla's excitement was
infectious, but Nancy couldn't shake the feeling that they were stepping into something much bigger than
either of them realized. Still, as they finished breakfast and prepared to head back to the McKay house, Nancy
couldn't help but feel a flicker of hope. If Layla's enthusiasm was any indication, maybe this was exactly what
she needed—a connection to her parents' work, a piece of her old life that felt alive again.
