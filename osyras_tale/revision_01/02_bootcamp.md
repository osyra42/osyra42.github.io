# Chapter 2 - Processing

Transport was a black SUV with tinted windows and a driver who didn’t speak. It felt less like a ride and more like an extradition. The coordinates led to a private airstrip where a twin-prop plane, unmarked and utilitarian, swallowed me and two other recruits—a wiry man who kept cracking his knuckles and a woman with a thousand-yard stare who looked at nothing at all. We flew in silence, the drone of the engines a physical pressure in my sensitive ears. I took another pill with a sip of tepid water from a canteen. The chemical calm settled over me like a layer of clear ice.

We landed on a dusty strip carved into dense, evergreen forest. The air was thin, cold, and smelled of pine resin and damp earth. A concrete bunker of a building squatted at the tree line. A sign above the heavy double doors read: **TITAN REACH – ASSESSMENT & ACCLIMATIZATION FACILITY.**

Inside, it was all harsh fluorescence and echoing linoleum. A bored-looking sergeant at a kiosk took my name, scanned my retina, and slapped a plastic wristband on me. “Welcome to the Combine, cadet. Follow the green line. Don’t wander. Don’t touch anything.”

The “green line” was a literal strip of luminous tape on the floor. It led through a maze of corridors. The place hummed with activity, but it was a sterile, purposeful kind—the clatter of gear, the murmur of voices from behind closed doors, the distant thump of what might have been gym equipment.

And everywhere, the stares.

The first cluster of recruits saw me as I was funneled into a larger holding area—a gymnasium converted into a processing hub with rows of temporary cots and locker bays. Maybe two dozen people, all in varying stages of intake, all hard-looking, all sizing each other up.

My hood was up, but my tail was visible, and the tips of my ears poked through my hair. The murmurs started like a rustle of dry leaves.

“...the hell is that?”
“Check out the tail. No way.”
“Costume party’s that way, freak.”

A big guy with a shaved head and a neck like a tree stump nudged his friend, a lanky redhead. “Look, a Fido. You lose your master, puppy?”

The redhead grinned. “Maybe she’s here for the K-9 unit. Wrong door, Furry.”

Heat rose up my neck, but it was the old, shameful kind, not the biological one. The pill kept that furnace banked. I kept my eyes on the green line, my face blank. *Don’t react. Don’t give them the satisfaction.* It was the same rule from every lab, every school hallway, every crowded street.

A staff member in grey fatigues appeared, clipboard in hand. “Osyra. With me. Custom fitting.”

I broke from the line, feeling every eye bore into my back as I followed him out a side door. This became the rhythm of my day: brief periods in the common areas, punctuated by constant, solitary summons.

The gear fitting was in a small armory. A taciturn technician measured me with laser calipers, his brow furrowed. “Cranial circumference accounting for auricular structures… cervical spine to lumbar, note the caudal integration point… we’ll need a custom helmet, modified body armor for range of motion and tail articulation.” He muttered into a headset, “Yeah, send up the prototyping putty. It’s the chimera candidate.”

Back in the gym, a new group had arrived. The whispers were louder now, more confident.
“Ugly as sin. What kind of sick mod is that?”
“Bet it smells like wet dog.”

I found a vacant cot in a corner and sat, pulling my knees to my chest, making myself small. The stares were a physical weight.

Then, a different summons. “Osyra. Medical Bay 3. Vaccine protocol.”

In a stark white room, a doctor with a nervous smile consulted a thick digital file. “Ah, yes. Subject presents with a recombinant retro-viral integration. Standard immunoboosters are contraindicated. We’ll be administering a tailored series to avoid triggering an autoimmune response against the non-human cellular lines.” The series of shots burned, a deep, aching cold that spread from the injection sites.

Each time I returned to the gym, the hostility had crystallized. I was no longer just a curiosity; I was a target. A focus for the universal anxiety of the place. My difference was a language they all understood, and they spoke it with cruelty.

“Hey, Mutant,” the big guy, Stumps, called as I walked back from medical, my arm throbbing. “They giving you your rabies shot? Should be mandatory.”

A few chuckles rippled around him. I kept walking, my tail rigid, my ears flat inside my hood.

That’s when a new voice cut through, quiet but carrying a strange, deliberate intensity.

“Shut up, Evers.”

It came from a recruit leaning against the lockers. He was tall, leanly built, with sharp, watchful features and dark hair cropped close to his skull. His eyes, a pale, crystalline grey, were fixed not on me, but on Stumps. There was no anger in his face, just a cool, assessing focus.

Stumps puffed up. “What’d you say, pretty boy?”

The lean recruit pushed off the lockers. He didn’t move aggressively, but with a relaxed, economical grace that was somehow more threatening. He glanced at me, his gaze sweeping from my hidden ears to my tense posture, then back to Stumps. His eyes widened slightly, as if connecting dots only he could see.

“I said, shut up,” he repeated, his voice still low. “You have no idea what you’re looking at.”

“I’m looking at a circus act,” Stumps sneered.

The lean recruit shook his head slowly, a faint, almost awed smile touching his lips. He looked back at me, and this time his stare wasn’t one of disgust or mockery. It was one of pure, unvarnished fascination. Awe.

“No,” he said, loud enough for the surrounding recruits to hear. A hush fell, eager for new drama. “You’re looking at a prototype. I’ve heard whispers about this. Deep-bio black ops stuff. They don’t mod for looks. They mod for function.”

He took a step closer, his eyes locked on me as if I were a fascinating blueprint. “Look at the base of the spine. Perfect for balance and kinetic transfer. The auricular mobility? 360-degree audio surveillance, no tech required. The ocular pigmentation? That’s for low-light and thermal tracking.” He was inventing it on the spot, but his conviction was magnetic. “They didn’t make a pet. They built a super-soldier. And you’re calling it names.”

The silence in our corner of the gym was absolute. Stumps’s bluster deflated, replaced by a dawning, uncertain fear. The other recruits stared at me with new eyes—not seeing a monster, but a weapon. The mockery was gone, replaced by wary, calculating distance.

The lean recruit held my gaze for a moment longer. In his grey eyes, I saw no pity, no kindness. Just the cool, approving gleam of a fanatic recognizing a superior piece of engineering. He gave me a slight, almost imperceptible nod.

Then he turned and walked away, leaving a void of tense quiet behind him.

I sat back down on my cot, the echoes of his words ringing in my ears. Super-soldier. Prototype. Built.

The stares were different now. No longer mocking, but wary. Calculating. The big guy, Stumps, wouldn’t meet my eyes at all. Fear was a cleaner, simpler barrier than contempt. It gave me space.

I pulled my hood tighter. The pill’s calm held firm, a lake of ice over a deep, dark sea. But beneath that ice, a new, pragmatic thought crystallized.

It was an interesting idea. To roleplay as a super-soldier. To lean into the rumor, to wear their awed fear like a cloak. They wanted to see a weapon? Fine. Let them. It was better than being a pet, a freak, a "Fido." Maybe, within these walls, performance was everything. Maybe I could get some type of respect—or at least, a safer distance—by pretending to be exactly the monster they’d already decided I was.

The boot camp hadn't officially begun, and I was already alone in a room full of people. But now, at least, I had a role to play.

The tension in the gymnasium had settled into a fragile, watchful stalemate over the past week. The mockery had died, choked off by the rumor of the "super-soldier" and by my own deliberate silence. I perfected the hateful stare—a flat, unblinking look that made my unnatural red eyes seem less like a flaw and more like a targeting laser. I’d aim it at anyone who lingered too long, and they’d find something else to look at.

Processing was a blur of more custom fittings, psych evals, and endless waiting. On the second day, they’d issued the uniform: standard Titan Reach fatigues, a digital grey-green, but mine had been subtly altered. The shirt collar was widened, the back of the trousers reinforced with a gusset of tougher material at the base of my spine. Wearing it felt strange—less like putting on clothes and more like being fitted for a new, official kind of skin. The message was clear: I was being standardized, but I was apart.

The day of transport to the main training barracks arrived, and the distinction became a public spectacle. We were herded into a cold, pre-dawn formation in the yard outside the bunker. About fifty of us, a ragged, shivering line of recruits in identical fatigues, clutching duffels of standard-issue gear. There was no discipline yet, just a jostling, anxious crowd.

A staff sergeant with a face like a hatchet stood on a crate. “Listen up, maggots! You are no longer civilians. You are names on a manifest. You will be addressed by your last names, and you will respond with ‘Yes, Sergeant!’ or ‘No, Sergeant!’ Is that understood?”

A mumbled, uneven chorus of “Yes, Sergeant!” echoed back.

“Pathetic!” he roared. “Now, first row, move! And keep your traps shut!”

As the first recruits shuffled toward the idling bus, the sergeant’s eyes found me at the back of the group. He pointed a rigid finger. “You. Renaya. The special project. You’re separate. You do not board until I say. You will take the last seat, the one marked with red tape. You will not speak to anyone. You follow all instructions given to the group, but you do it alone. You are not part of this platoon. You are an attachment. Do you comprehend?”

Every head in uniform turned. The hateful stare wasn’t enough here; I could feel the eyes like physical pressure against the stiff fabric of my collar. “Yes, Sergeant,” I said, my voice clear and toneless.

“Good. Remember it.”

One by one, the last names were barked, and recruits filed onto the bus. I watched them go, my own duffel at my feet. Finally, the sergeant barked, “Renaya! Forward!”

I walked the gauntlet of uniformed faces in the bus windows—curious, hostile, afraid. I climbed the steps. The interior was silent, the air thick with anticipation. And there, at the very back, was a single seat, its cracked vinyl marked with a glaring ‘X’ of red duct tape. An island.

“Sit!” the sergeant yelled from outside.

I slid into the red-taped seat, stowing my gear. The space around me felt electrically charged, a buffer zone of pure isolation. The driver closed the door, and the bus lurched forward, beginning the long, winding journey deeper into the forest.

For the first hour, there was a tense, exhausted quiet. Then, about thirty minutes from the destination, it began.

It started with a single, brutal shout from the front of the bus. A drill instructor I hadn’t even seen board was suddenly on his feet, his face contorted with pure fury.

“WHAT IS THIS, A GIRL SCOUT TOUR? THIS BUS IS NOW A WARZONE! HEADS! BETWEEN! YOUR! KNEES! NOW! ALL OF YOU! DO IT!”

Chaos. Recruits fumbled, diving forward, their uniform caps tumbling. “I CAN’T HEAR YOUR FOREHEADS HITTING THE SEATS! HARDER! YOU THINK THE ENEMY GIVES YOU NECK PILLOWS?”

This was the Shark Attack. The deliberate, overwhelming verbal assault designed to erase individuality and instill instant, blind obedience. The DI paced the aisle, his voice a constant, deafening percussion against the bus's metal shell.

“NO LOOKING! EYES ON YOUR BOOTS OR THE DECK! YOU LOOK AT ME, I’LL PERSONALLY PEEL YOUR EYELIDS BACK! SHUT UP! THE ONLY SOUND I WANT IS YOUR WEAK LITTLE HEARTS TRYING NOT TO GIVE OUT!”

I followed the order, pressing my forehead against the cool metal of the pill case in my hands, the stiff brim of my uniform cap digging into my wrist. My sensitive ears, pinned flat beneath the cap, rang with the volume, every shout a physical slap. He did not single me out; the storm was democratic, brutal, and all-encompassing.

“YOU ARE NOTHING! YOU ARE WORTHLESS! YOU WILL DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD, WHEN YOU ARE TOLD, HOW YOU ARE TOLD! YOUR GEAR IS YOUR ONLY FRIEND! GET IT BETWEEN YOUR LEGS! HUG IT! LOVE IT! IT’S THE ONLY THING THAT MIGHT SAVE YOUR MISERABLE LIFE!”

The bus echoed with the sounds of scrambling, of duffels being wrestled into positions, of panicked, held breaths. The DI’s boots crunched past my red-taped seat without pause. I was just another recruit in fatigues with her head down, obeying. The anonymity of the abuse was, perversely, a relief.

The Shark Attack lasted the entire final half-hour of the journey. By the time the bus crunched to a halt on gravel, the silence that replaced the shouting felt hollow and ringing. My neck ached. My hands were numb from gripping the case.

“OFF MY BUS! NOW! MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! FORM A LINE ON THE YARD! DUFFELS AT YOUR FEET! EYES FRONT! MOVE LIKE YOUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT, BECAUSE STARTING TODAY, THEY DO!”

Recruits stumbled into the aisle, their uniforms rumpled, their movements jerky with residual fear. I waited, as instructed, until the bus was nearly empty. Then I stood, adjusting my cap, slinging my duffel, clutching the metal case.

I was the last one down the steps. The scene on the yard was one of shell-shocked recruits trying to form lines under the blistering shouts of three drill instructors. One of them, a mountain of a man with a shaved scalp and the same voice that had led the Shark Attack, saw me. His eyes, taking in the uniform, the case, my position, held no personal malice—only the flat, assessing glare he’d give any piece of irregular equipment on his manifest.

“RENAYA!” he bellowed. Not a taunt, a designation. “The attachment! You don’t get in line! You stand there!” He pointed to a spot ten feet to the left of the ragged formation, his gesture as precise as a surveyor’s. “You are a shadow! You follow all training, but you are not of this platoon! Understood?”

“Understood, Drill Sergeant!” I shouted, the words raw in my throat. I marched to the spot, dropped my duffel, snapped to attention, the metal case held rigidly at my side. The stiff fabric of my trousers felt taut across my back.

He gave me one final, impersonal glance—a commander confirming a logistical detail—then turned his full, terrifying focus back to the main platoon. “WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT, MAGGOTS? YOUR JOB IS TO LEARN, NOT GAPE! EYES FRONT!”

I stared straight ahead, over the heads of the identically dressed recruits, at the stark, grey wall of the nearest barracks building. The cool metal of the case bit into my palm through my uniform glove. The Shark Attack’s adrenaline was still buzzing in my veins, mixing uneasily with the pill's artificial calm.

The first week was not about being different. It was about being broken down.

The humiliation was total, but it was democratic. It wasn't personal, because nothing here was personal. You were a body in uniform, and your body was weak, slow, and stupid. When one recruit fumbled a drill step, the entire platoon paid for it in push-ups on the gravel, the DI's voice shredding the air above us. When someone's footlocker was a millimeter out of alignment during inspection, we all stood at attention for an hour in the biting cold as he methodlessly dumped every locker in the bay onto the floor. The lesson was a blunt instrument: you are a cell in an organism. One cell fails, the whole body suffers.

My unique status as the "attachment" meant I stood apart during formations, but I suffered alongside them during the consequences. I did the push-ups. I stood in the cold. I scrubbed. And I stood a full head taller than almost everyone while doing it. At 6'4", my height had always been a fact; here, in ranks of recruits who averaged 5'10", it became a permanent feature of the landscape. I had to consciously slump during some drills to not break the line, a habit the DIs quickly beat out of me. "STAND AT YOUR GOD-GIVEN ATTENTION, RENAYA! DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR THE BLUEPRINT!"

There was so much cleaning. Floors had to gleam like obsidian. Latrines had to smell of nothing but bleach. We scrubbed with toothbrushes, with rags, with our own fingernails. The smell of industrial cleaner became a permanent note in the back of my throat. My height was an advantage here; no shelf was out of reach, and I was often tasked with the high dusting and light fixtures while others grumbled at baseboards.

The physical training was a relentless grind. Calisthenics at 0400 in the dark. Long, grueling runs in formation, the pack's rhythm a punishing, collective heartbeat. My enhanced physiology handled the cardio better than most—my lungs burned, but they didn't scream—and my long legs gave me a stride that made the runs feel almost natural, though I had to constantly check my pace to avoid overtaking the file. The sheer, repetitive volume of it wore on everyone. My muscles ached with a new, deep kind of fatigue, and my tail often felt like a dead weight, a clumsy appendage I had to consciously tuck and control during exercises.

By the third day, a plague of respiratory illness swept through the bay. The sound of wet, hacking coughs and congested sniffling was a constant chorus. Sinus pain made faces puffy and eyes watery. The DIs showed no mercy. "I DON'T CARE IF YOU'RE COUGHING UP A LUNG, MAGGOT! YOU MOVE!" I watched recruits stumble through drills, shivering with fever, only to collapse afterwards. I stayed healthy—another side-effect of Chimera 9, my father’s logs had noted a 'robust adaptive immune response'—but the misery around me was palpable, a fog of human vulnerability I looked down upon from my healthy, unwanted height.

Then came the weapons.

The armory was a temple of oil and cold metal. We filed past, and the armorer, a grizzled specialist with sergeant's stripes, called out assignments. "Smith, M4. Gonzalez, M4. Carter, M4."

He reached me. His eyes flicked from his manifest up to my face—a longer journey than for most—then to a different, heavier rack. "Renaya. Mk 13 Mod 7. .300 Winchester Magnum. Bolt-action precision rifle. With this."

He handed me the rifle. It was a beast. Over four feet long, with a thick, fluted barrel, a massive muzzle brake, and a chunky telescopic sight. The weight settled into my hands—a dense, profound 13 pounds of cold steel, polymer, and glass. It felt less like a weapon and more like a piece of industrial machinery meant to be mounted. Compared to the 6.4-pound M4 carbines the others cradled like toys, it was from another world. In my hands, its scale finally made sense. It didn't look oversized; it looked correct. A full-sized weapon for a full-sized frame.

A stunned silence, then a sharp, collective intake of breath. Heads turned. I saw a recruit named Finch, two people ahead, his neck craning, his eyes wide as saucers.

Before he could even blink, the armorer’s voice cracked like a whip. “FINCH! YOU SEE SOMETHING PRETTY? YOU ON A TOUR? YOUR WEAPON IS IN YOUR HANDS! EYES ON YOUR OWN GEAR UNLESS YOU WANT TO CLEAN EVERY WEAPON IN THIS ARMORY WITH A TOOTHBRUSH!”

Finch’s head snapped forward so fast I heard his neck pop. The lesson was immediate: staring at the anomaly was a failure of focus. It became a pattern. During zeroing on the range, as I settled behind the massive rifle, I’d feel eyes on me. A flicker of movement in my peripheral vision.

“HILL! YOU TRYING TO LEARN BY OSMOSIS? WISHING WON’T MAKE YOUR GROUPING TIGHTER! FOCUS ON YOUR FRONT SIGHT POST OR I’LL HAVE YOU WEARING IT AS AN EARRING!”

On a march, a recruit stumbling behind me would gawk at the rifle on my shoulder or the tip of my tail, adjusting to the rhythm of the walk.

“VALDEZ! THE ROAD IS IN FRONT OF YOU, NOT ON HER BACK! YOU LOST? NEED A MAP? PICK UP THE PACE AND WATCH YOUR SECTOR!”

The DIs never mocked me for being looked at. They mocked them for looking. It was a brilliant, ruthless piece of psychological conditioning. It made my difference not a source of personal humiliation, but a test for everyone else. A distraction to be overcome. A temptation to fail. Every time a head turned in my direction, it was an excuse for the DI to pounce, to punish, to reinforce the only thing that mattered: the task. My presence became a metric of their discipline.

The drawback of the Mk 13 was a constant, grinding presence. But so was the advantage, which revealed itself during a tactical drill. We were simulating guarding a perimeter. The DI pointed at me. "Renaya! That cannon is a liability inside ten meters. Simulate a security hand-off. Briggs! Secure her primary!"

Briggs, who had muscles on his muscles but stood a good eight inches shorter, stepped forward. I saw his eyes dart from my face to the rifle, a flicker of that same awe and apprehension.

“BRIGGS! YOU TAKING A CENSUS OF HER FEATURES OR SECURING A WEAPON? MOVE!”

He snapped to, but the damage was done—he was already off-balance. I unslung the Mk 13 and passed it to him. The moment the full weight transferred, his body jerked. His eyes widened as his posture sank, his arms instinctively tightening to wrestle the unexpected heft and length.

"Looks like a struggle, Briggs! You admiring the craftsmanship or fighting a bear? Renaya, you're weaponless! Demonstrate a hostile take-down. Non-lethal. Go."

Unburdened by the thirteen-pound anchor, my body became pure potential energy. I was across the gap in one long stride before Briggs could reset. I used his rooted, unbalanced posture against him, my longer arms easily bypassing his guard, sweeping his legs and driving him to the mat with a controlled thud.

The DI didn’t praise. He simply narrated, his voice cutting through the damp air as the platoon stood rigid, eyes fixed on nothing. "Observe. The hammer is heavy. The arm is built to carry it. A tool for every task." He paused, letting the silence hang. "Briggs, firewatch. The rest of you, look alive—at your own damn jobs."

It was a visceral, undeniable lesson. My "different" was a tactical specification, and noticing it was a punishable lapse. The recruits learned. The stares didn't stop, but they became covert, fleeting, followed by an immediate, paranoid snap back to whatever they were supposed to be doing. I was no longer a spectacle; I was a hazard. A distraction hazard. It was the most anonymity I’d had since I got here.

The only respite was food. The chow hall was a haven of shocking, greasy abundance. The food was, against all odds, awesome. Giant portions of pasta, real eggs, mountains of potatoes. Calories as fuel, and we were furnaces. My metabolism, coupled with my size, demanded a shocking amount of it. I ate with a single-minded, mechanical focus, often going back for seconds while others picked at their plates. Even the MREs—Meals, Ready-to-Eat—were acceptable in their weird, vacuum-sealed way. At the table, for fifteen minutes at a time, we were not maggots. We were just hungry animals, refueling in silence.

I sat alone, as always, at the end of a table. But now, the space around me felt less like an exile and more like a cleared range. No one looked too long. No one sat too close. I could eat in peace, the monstrous rifle leaning against the table like a silent guardian. I was the one who carried the thirteen-pound answer, and I was built on a scale that made it look logical. And if you were smart, you kept your eyes on your own tray.

I took a bite of gravy-soaked meatloaf. It was fuel. For now, that was enough. The rest was just physics, and I was finally starting to feel like I was built for the equation. The silence of their averted eyes was the closest thing to respect I was likely to get.

The gas chamber was a small, concrete-block building that smelled, even from the outside, like dread and old chemicals. We lined up in our protective masks, the tight rubber seals feeling alien against my face, pressing my ears flat. The DI, Sergeant Hale, stood by the door, his own mask making him look like a giant, unfeeling insect.

“This is CS gas. Tear gas. It will not kill you. It will make you wish you were dead. The point is to trust your gear, and to learn how to clear and seal your mask under stress. You will enter, form a line, and on my command, you will break the seal, remove your mask, state your name and rank, then reseal. Anyone who runs for the door before I say ‘go’ repeats. Anyone who doesn’t complete the exercise repeats. Understood?”

“YES, SERGEANT!”

One by one, we filed into the thick, hazy air inside. Even with the mask on, my eyes began to water. The air had a sharp, metallic taste that seeped through. Then came my turn.

“RENAYA! BREAK SEAL AND REMOVE!”

I pulled the mask from my face.

The world dissolved into instant, agonizing fire. It was like inhaling crushed glass and hornets. My lungs seized, a raw, scraping cough tearing from my throat. My eyes flooded, vision blurring into a smear of grey walls and green uniforms. But it was the other places—the places my parents had modified—that screamed the loudest. The sensitive inner fur of my ears felt like it was being seared with a thousand needles. The skin at the base of my tail, always a nexus of heightened sensation, burned as if splashed with acid. It was a pain I hadn’t anticipated, a vulnerability they hadn’t cataloged.

“NAME AND RANK!” Hale bellowed from somewhere in the burning fog.

I tried to suck in air to speak, and got a mouthful of fire. “RENAYA—!” I choked out, my voice a strangled rasp before a coughing fit doubled me over. Snot poured from my nose, thick and uncontrollable. All around me, the sounds were the same: retching, gagging, the wet, desperate hacking of fifty people drowning in their own mucus. The mysterious respiratory plague that had haunted the bay was instantly, violently cured. No one was congested anymore; every passage was ruthlessly, painfully clear.

“SEAL YOUR MASK!”

I fumbled the rubber back over my face, my fingers slick with tears and snot, and sucked in the sweet, filtered air. The relief was instantaneous, though the burning in my ears and tail throbbed for another hour. We stumbled out into the clean, cold daylight, faces raw and shining, all of us united in a new, profound understanding of misery. For a few minutes, no one looked at me. They were too busy trying to remember how to breathe.

***

Night ops came a week later. We were issued night-vision goggles—heavy, bulky units that turned the world into a ghostly green landscape of vague shapes and halos. We practiced moving in squads, communicating in whispers, the gear hissing and whining in our ears.

I tried to use them. I really did. But the amplified light was overwhelming, washing out details, and the limited field of view felt like looking through two foggy soda bottles. It was harder to see with them than without.

During a navigation exercise, moving through a dense patch of woods, I finally lifted the goggles onto my forehead. The world didn't just brighten; it clarified. My improved night vision rendered the darkness not as an obstacle, but as a different palette. The deep shadows held texture and depth. I could distinguish the grey of a rock from the grey of a root, see the subtle path of crushed leaves, track the heat-shimmer of a recruit’s body ten yards away as a faint, rippling disturbance in the cool air. My pupils, wide and dark, gathered every stray photon. I could hear the lieutenant’s whispered commands from two squads over with perfect clarity. I navigated the terrain not by stumbling through a green electronic haze, but by reading the real night as if it were a cloudy twilight.

“Renaya, why are your NODs stowed?” a voice hissed. It was Corporal Vance, one of the training cadre.

“They degrade my natural sight, Corporal. My night vision is sufficient.”

A long pause. I could feel his stare in the dark, but he couldn’t see my face clearly. “Noted. Keep up. And don’t make me regret this.”

I didn’t make him regret it. By the end of the exercise, I was quietly directing my squad around obstacles I could see and they couldn’t, my whispers keeping them from blundering into ditches or low branches. No one thanked me. But when we reassembled, our squad was the only one without a sprained ankle or a face full of spiderwebs. The looks I got were no longer of fear or disgust, but of grim, practical acknowledgment.

***

The PT tests were where things began to shift, almost imperceptibly. The tests were straightforward: a two-mile run, maximum push-ups in two minutes, maximum sit-ups in two minutes, pull-ups. For me, they were laughably easy. My body, built for endurance and power, performed with a cold efficiency that even I found unsettling.

But as I stood panting lightly after my run, watching others stagger across the finish line, faces purple with strain, something strange happened. I didn’t feel smug. I felt… impatient.

“Come on, Miller! You’ve got fifty yards! Dig! It’s just pain, leave it on the road!” The words were out of my mouth before I thought about them. Miller, a wiry guy who was usually one of the mockers, shot me a look of pure shock, then grimaced and found a last, desperate sprint.

On the pull-up bar, I watched Carter fail on his seventh rep, his arms shaking. “Don’t let your knees drift, Carter! Lock your core! You’ve got three more in you, I know you do!” He grunted, heaved, and got an eighth.

It wasn’t kindness. It was a brutal sort of pragmatism. We were a cell in an organism. If the cell next to me was weak, it made the whole body weaker. My own performance was irrelevant if the platoon failed. The DIs had beaten that into us. And for the first time, I internalized it not as a threat, but as a mechanic of survival.

Slowly, tentatively, I became able to lead. Not by appointment, but by default. During ruck marches, when someone’s pack strap was digging in, I’d bark the adjustment drill sergeant Hale had taught us. During the endless, mind-numbing parade drills, when the rank would lose its dressing, my height and voice from the flank would call the alignment back. “Dress right, DRESS! Hold your interval, Garcia!”

The most profound comfort was the silence from the DIs. They never blamed me for being different. They only ever blamed the others for *noticing*. “YOU STARING AT HER FEET TO LEARN THE CADENCE, JENKINS? EYES FRONT!” That simple, consistent reinforcement was a balm I hadn’t known I needed. My existence was not the problem. Their lack of focus was.

We did ruck marches that felt like they would never end, the weight of the Mk 13 an old, familiar enemy on my shoulder. We did hand-to-hand combat in the gritty pits, where my reach and speed became assets I learned to control, not just flail. We did parade drills until the movements were autonomic, my tail held in a tight, still curl against my leg. We did a form of camping they called “bivouacking,” which was mostly lying in a cold, damp hole in the ground trying not to shiver, listening to the forest with ears that heard every rustle and snap.

I was not becoming one of them. That was never the goal. The red-tape seat on the bus still existed. But the space around me was no longer a vacuum of hostility. It was a space of… function. I was a unique tool in the kit, and the other tools were slowly, grudgingly, learning how to work alongside me. And I, to my own surprise, was starting to care if they could do their jobs.

I was losing my self-conscious mindset. The constant, withering internal narration of *freak, monster, mistake* was being drowned out by the external, immediate demands of the task: *Move faster. Shoot straighter. Carry more. Help them.*

The beast in my blood, the one that had driven me to a stranger on a rooftop, was being channeled. Given a direction. Given a pack, however dysfunctional.

It was a different kind of cage. But for the first time in my life, the walls weren’t there just to contain me. They were there to shape me into something that could, perhaps, eventually break out.

The gas chamber was a small, concrete-block building that smelled, even from the outside, like dread and old chemicals. We lined up in our protective masks, the tight rubber seals feeling alien against my face, pressing my ears flat. The DI, Sergeant Hale, stood by the door, his own mask making him look like a giant, unfeeling insect.

“This is CS gas. Tear gas. It will not kill you. It will make you wish you were dead. The point is to trust your gear, and to learn how to clear and seal your mask under stress. You will enter, form a line, and on my command, you will break the seal, remove your mask, state your name and rank, then reseal. Anyone who runs for the door before I say ‘go’ repeats. Anyone who doesn’t complete the exercise repeats. Understood?”

“YES, SERGEANT!”

One by one, we filed into the thick, hazy air inside. Even with the mask on, my eyes began to water. The air had a sharp, metallic taste that seeped through. Then came my turn.

“RENAYA! BREAK SEAL AND REMOVE!”

I pulled the mask from my face.

The world dissolved into instant, agonizing fire. It was like inhaling crushed glass and hornets. My lungs seized, a raw, scraping cough tearing from my throat. My eyes flooded, vision blurring into a smear of grey walls and green uniforms. But it was the other places—the places my parents had modified—that screamed the loudest. The sensitive inner fur of my ears felt like it was being seared with a thousand needles. The skin at the base of my tail, always a nexus of heightened sensation, burned as if splashed with acid. It was a pain I hadn’t anticipated, a vulnerability they hadn’t cataloged.

“NAME AND RANK!” Hale bellowed from somewhere in the burning fog.

I tried to suck in air to speak, and got a mouthful of fire. “RENAYA—!” I choked out, my voice a strangled rasp before a coughing fit doubled me over. Snot poured from my nose, thick and uncontrollable. All around me, the sounds were the same: retching, gagging, the wet, desperate hacking of fifty people drowning in their own mucus. The mysterious respiratory plague that had haunted the bay was instantly, violently cured. No one was congested anymore; every passage was ruthlessly, painfully clear.

“SEAL YOUR MASK!”

I fumbled the rubber back over my face, my fingers slick with tears and snot, and sucked in the sweet, filtered air. The relief was instantaneous, though the burning in my ears and tail throbbed for another hour. We stumbled out into the clean, cold daylight, faces raw and shining, all of us united in a new, profound understanding of misery. For a few minutes, no one looked at me. They were too busy trying to remember how to breathe.

Night ops came a week later. We were issued night-vision goggles—heavy, bulky units that turned the world into a ghostly green landscape of vague shapes and halos. We practiced moving in squads, communicating in whispers, the gear hissing and whining in our ears.

I tried to use them. I really did. But the amplified light was overwhelming, washing out details, and the limited field of view felt like looking through two foggy soda bottles. It was harder to see with them than without.

During a navigation exercise, moving through a dense patch of woods, I finally lifted the goggles onto my forehead. The world snapped into a clarity the gear could never match. The darkness wasn’t black; it was a tapestry of deep blues, greys, and silvers. I could see the texture of bark, the individual needles on the pines, the heat shimmer of a recruit’s body ten yards away as a faint, pulsing aura against the cool background. I could hear the lieutenant’s whispered commands from two squads over. I navigated the terrain as if it were dusk, not midnight.

“Renaya, why are your NODs stowed?” a voice hissed. It was Corporal Vance, one of the training cadre.

“They’re a detriment, Corporal. I have sufficient natural low-light vision.”

A long pause. I could feel his stare in the dark, but he couldn’t see my face clearly. “Noted. Keep up. And for God’s sake, don’t trip.”

I didn’t trip. By the end of the exercise, I was quietly directing my squad around obstacles I could see and they couldn’t, my whispers keeping them from blundering into ditches or low branches. No one thanked me. But no one argued, either.

The PT tests were where things began to shift, almost imperceptibly. The tests were straightforward: a two-mile run, maximum push-ups in two minutes, maximum sit-ups in two minutes, pull-ups. For me, they were laughably easy. My body, built for endurance and power, performed with a cold efficiency that even I found unsettling.

But as I stood panting lightly after my run, watching others stagger across the finish line, faces purple with strain, something strange happened. I didn’t feel smug. I felt… impatient.

“Come on, Miller! You’ve got fifty yards! Dig! It’s just pain, leave it on the road!” The words were out of my mouth before I thought about them. Miller, a wiry guy who was usually one of the mockers, shot me a look of pure shock, then grimaced and found a last, desperate sprint.

On the pull-up bar, I watched Carter fail on his seventh rep, his arms shaking. “Don’t let your knees drift, Carter! Lock your core! You’ve got three more in you, I know you do!” He grunted, heaved, and got an eighth.

It wasn’t kindness. It was a brutal sort of pragmatism. We were a cell in an organism. If the cell next to me was weak, it made the whole body weaker. My own performance was irrelevant if the platoon failed. The DIs had beaten that into us. And for the first time, I internalized it not as a threat, but as a mechanic of survival.

Slowly, tentatively, I became able to lead. Not by appointment, but by default. During ruck marches, when someone’s pack strap was digging in, I’d bark the adjustment drill sergeant Hale had taught us. During the endless, mind-numbing parade drills, when the rank would lose its dressing, my height and voice from the flank would call the alignment back. “Dress right, DRESS! Hold your interval, Garcia!”

The most profound comfort was the silence from the DIs. They never blamed me for being different. They only ever blamed the others for *noticing*. “YOU STARING AT HER FEET TO LEARN THE CADENCE, JENKINS? EYES FRONT!” That simple, consistent reinforcement was a balm I hadn’t known I needed. My existence was not the problem. Their lack of focus was.

We did ruck marches that felt like they would never end, the weight of the Mk 13 an old, familiar enemy on my shoulder. We did hand-to-hand combat in the gritty pits, where my reach and speed became assets I learned to control, not just flail. We did parade drills until the movements were autonomic, my tail held in a tight, still curl against my leg. We did a form of camping they called “bivouacking,” which was mostly lying in a cold, damp hole in the ground trying not to shiver, listening to the forest with ears that heard every rustle and snap.

I was not becoming one of them. That was never the goal. The red-tape seat on the bus still existed. But the space around me was no longer a vacuum of hostility. It was a space of… function. I was a unique tool in the kit, and the other tools were slowly, grudgingly, learning how to work alongside me. And I, to my own surprise, was starting to care if they could do their jobs.

I was losing my self-conscious mindset. The constant, withering internal narration of *freak, monster, mistake* was being drowned out by the external, immediate demands of the task: *Move faster. Shoot straighter. Carry more. Help them.*

The beast in my blood, the one that had driven me to a stranger on a rooftop, was being channeled. Given a direction. Given a pack, however dysfunctional.

It was a different kind of cage. But for the first time in my life, the walls weren’t there just to contain me. They were there to shape me into something that could, perhaps, eventually break out.
