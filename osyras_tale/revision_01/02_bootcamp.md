**Chapter 2 - Processing**

Transport was a black SUV with tinted windows and a driver who didn’t speak. It felt less like a ride and more like an extradition. The coordinates led to a private airstrip where a twin-prop plane, unmarked and utilitarian, swallowed me and two other recruits—a wiry man who kept cracking his knuckles and a woman with a thousand-yard stare who looked at nothing at all. We flew in silence, the drone of the engines a physical pressure in my sensitive ears. I took another pill with a sip of tepid water from a canteen. The chemical calm settled over me like a layer of clear ice.

We landed on a dusty strip carved into dense, evergreen forest. The air was thin, cold, and smelled of pine resin and damp earth. A concrete bunker of a building squatted at the tree line. A sign above the heavy double doors read: **TITAN REACH – ASSESSMENT & ACCLIMATIZATION FACILITY.**

Inside, it was all harsh fluorescence and echoing linoleum. A bored-looking sergeant at a kiosk took my name, scanned my retina, and slapped a plastic wristband on me. “Welcome to the Combine, cadet. Follow the green line. Don’t wander. Don’t touch anything.”

The “green line” was a literal strip of luminous tape on the floor. It led through a maze of corridors. The place hummed with activity, but it was a sterile, purposeful kind—the clatter of gear, the murmur of voices from behind closed doors, the distant thump of what might have been gym equipment.

And everywhere, the stares.

The first cluster of recruits saw me as I was funneled into a larger holding area—a gymnasium converted into a processing hub with rows of temporary cots and locker bays. Maybe two dozen people, all in varying stages of intake, all hard-looking, all sizing each other up.

My hood was up, but my tail was visible, and the tips of my ears poked through my hair. The murmurs started like a rustle of dry leaves.

“...the hell is that?”
“Check out the tail. No way.”
“Costume party’s that way, freak.”

A big guy with a shaved head and a neck like a tree stump nudged his friend, a lanky redhead. “Look, a Fido. You lose your master, puppy?”

The redhead grinned. “Maybe she’s here for the K-9 unit. Wrong door, Furry.”

Heat rose up my neck, but it was the old, shameful kind, not the biological one. The pill kept that furnace banked. I kept my eyes on the green line, my face blank. *Don’t react. Don’t give them the satisfaction.* It was the same rule from every lab, every school hallway, every crowded street.

A staff member in grey fatigues appeared, clipboard in hand. “Osyra. With me. Custom fitting.”

I broke from the line, feeling every eye bore into my back as I followed him out a side door. This became the rhythm of my day: brief periods in the common areas, punctuated by constant, solitary summons.

The gear fitting was in a small armory. A taciturn technician measured me with laser calipers, his brow furrowed. “Cranial circumference accounting for auricular structures… cervical spine to lumbar, note the caudal integration point… we’ll need a custom helmet, modified body armor for range of motion and tail articulation.” He muttered into a headset, “Yeah, send up the prototyping putty. It’s the chimera candidate.”

Back in the gym, a new group had arrived. The whispers were louder now, more confident.
“Ugly as sin. What kind of sick mod is that?”
“Bet it smells like wet dog.”

I found a vacant cot in a corner and sat, pulling my knees to my chest, making myself small. The stares were a physical weight.

Then, a different summons. “Osyra. Medical Bay 3. Vaccine protocol.”

In a stark white room, a doctor with a nervous smile consulted a thick digital file. “Ah, yes. Subject presents with a recombinant retro-viral integration. Standard immunoboosters are contraindicated. We’ll be administering a tailored series to avoid triggering an autoimmune response against the non-human cellular lines.” The series of shots burned, a deep, aching cold that spread from the injection sites.

Each time I returned to the gym, the hostility had crystallized. I was no longer just a curiosity; I was a target. A focus for the universal anxiety of the place. My difference was a language they all understood, and they spoke it with cruelty.

“Hey, Mutant,” the big guy, Stumps, called as I walked back from medical, my arm throbbing. “They giving you your rabies shot? Should be mandatory.”

A few chuckles rippled around him. I kept walking, my tail rigid, my ears flat inside my hood.

That’s when a new voice cut through, quiet but carrying a strange, deliberate intensity.

“Shut up, Evers.”

It came from a recruit leaning against the lockers. He was tall, leanly built, with sharp, watchful features and dark hair cropped close to his skull. His eyes, a pale, crystalline grey, were fixed not on me, but on Stumps. There was no anger in his face, just a cool, assessing focus.

Stumps puffed up. “What’d you say, pretty boy?”

The lean recruit pushed off the lockers. He didn’t move aggressively, but with a relaxed, economical grace that was somehow more threatening. He glanced at me, his gaze sweeping from my hidden ears to my tense posture, then back to Stumps. His eyes widened slightly, as if connecting dots only he could see.

“I said, shut up,” he repeated, his voice still low. “You have no idea what you’re looking at.”

“I’m looking at a circus act,” Stumps sneered.

The lean recruit shook his head slowly, a faint, almost awed smile touching his lips. He looked back at me, and this time his stare wasn’t one of disgust or mockery. It was one of pure, unvarnished fascination. Awe.

“No,” he said, loud enough for the surrounding recruits to hear. A hush fell, eager for new drama. “You’re looking at a prototype. I’ve heard whispers about this. Deep-bio black ops stuff. They don’t mod for looks. They mod for function.”

He took a step closer, his eyes locked on me as if I were a fascinating blueprint. “Look at the base of the spine. Perfect for balance and kinetic transfer. The auricular mobility? 360-degree audio surveillance, no tech required. The ocular pigmentation? That’s for low-light and thermal tracking.” He was inventing it on the spot, but his conviction was magnetic. “They didn’t make a pet. They built a super-soldier. And you’re calling it names.”

The silence in our corner of the gym was absolute. Stumps’s bluster deflated, replaced by a dawning, uncertain fear. The other recruits stared at me with new eyes—not seeing a monster, but a weapon. The mockery was gone, replaced by wary, calculating distance.

The lean recruit held my gaze for a moment longer. In his grey eyes, I saw no pity, no kindness. Just the cool, approving gleam of a fanatic recognizing a superior piece of engineering. He gave me a slight, almost imperceptible nod.

Then he turned and walked away, leaving a void of tense quiet behind him.

I sat back down on my cot, the echoes of his words ringing in my ears. Super-soldier. Prototype. Built.

The stares were different now. No longer mocking, but wary. Calculating. The big guy, Stumps, wouldn’t meet my eyes at all. Fear was a cleaner, simpler barrier than contempt. It gave me space.

I pulled my hood tighter. The pill’s calm held firm, a lake of ice over a deep, dark sea. But beneath that ice, a new, pragmatic thought crystallized.

It was an interesting idea. To roleplay as a super-soldier. To lean into the rumor, to wear their awed fear like a cloak. They wanted to see a weapon? Fine. Let them. It was better than being a pet, a freak, a "Fido." Maybe, within these walls, performance was everything. Maybe I could get some type of respect—or at least, a safer distance—by pretending to be exactly the monster they’d already decided I was.

The boot camp hadn't officially begun, and I was already alone in a room full of people. But now, at least, I had a role to play.

The tension in the gymnasium had settled into a fragile, watchful stalemate over the past week. The mockery had died, choked off by the rumor of the "super-soldier" and by my own deliberate silence. I perfected the hateful stare—a flat, unblinking look that made my unnatural red eyes seem less like a flaw and more like a targeting laser. I’d aim it at anyone who lingered too long, and they’d find something else to look at.

Processing was a blur of more custom fittings, psych evals, and endless waiting. On the second day, they’d issued the uniform: standard Titan Reach fatigues, a digital grey-green, but mine had been subtly altered. The shirt collar was widened, the back of the trousers reinforced with a gusset of tougher material at the base of my spine. Wearing it felt strange—less like putting on clothes and more like being fitted for a new, official kind of skin. The message was clear: I was being standardized, but I was apart.

The day of transport to the main training barracks arrived, and the distinction became a public spectacle. We were herded into a cold, pre-dawn formation in the yard outside the bunker. About fifty of us, a ragged, shivering line of recruits in identical fatigues, clutching duffels of standard-issue gear. There was no discipline yet, just a jostling, anxious crowd.

A staff sergeant with a face like a hatchet stood on a crate. “Listen up, maggots! You are no longer civilians. You are names on a manifest. You will be addressed by your last names, and you will respond with ‘Yes, Sergeant!’ or ‘No, Sergeant!’ Is that understood?”

A mumbled, uneven chorus of “Yes, Sergeant!” echoed back.

“Pathetic!” he roared. “Now, first row, move! And keep your traps shut!”

As the first recruits shuffled toward the idling bus, the sergeant’s eyes found me at the back of the group. He pointed a rigid finger. “You. Renaya. The special project. You’re separate. You do not board until I say. You will take the last seat, the one marked with red tape. You will not speak to anyone. You follow all instructions given to the group, but you do it alone. You are not part of this platoon. You are an attachment. Do you comprehend?”

Every head in uniform turned. The hateful stare wasn’t enough here; I could feel the eyes like physical pressure against the stiff fabric of my collar. “Yes, Sergeant,” I said, my voice clear and toneless.

“Good. Remember it.”

One by one, the last names were barked, and recruits filed onto the bus. I watched them go, my own duffel at my feet. Finally, the sergeant barked, “Renaya! Forward!”

I walked the gauntlet of uniformed faces in the bus windows—curious, hostile, afraid. I climbed the steps. The interior was silent, the air thick with anticipation. And there, at the very back, was a single seat, its cracked vinyl marked with a glaring ‘X’ of red duct tape. An island.

“Sit!” the sergeant yelled from outside.

I slid into the red-taped seat, stowing my gear. The space around me felt electrically charged, a buffer zone of pure isolation. The driver closed the door, and the bus lurched forward, beginning the long, winding journey deeper into the forest.

For the first hour, there was a tense, exhausted quiet. Then, about thirty minutes from the destination, it began.

It started with a single, brutal shout from the front of the bus. A drill instructor I hadn’t even seen board was suddenly on his feet, his face contorted with pure fury.

“WHAT IS THIS, A GIRL SCOUT TOUR? THIS BUS IS NOW A WARZONE! HEADS! BETWEEN! YOUR! KNEES! NOW! ALL OF YOU! DO IT!”

Chaos. Recruits fumbled, diving forward, their uniform caps tumbling. “I CAN’T HEAR YOUR FOREHEADS HITTING THE SEATS! HARDER! YOU THINK THE ENEMY GIVES YOU NECK PILLOWS?”

This was the Shark Attack. The deliberate, overwhelming verbal assault designed to erase individuality and instill instant, blind obedience. The DI paced the aisle, his voice a constant, deafening percussion against the bus's metal shell.

“NO LOOKING! EYES ON YOUR BOOTS OR THE DECK! YOU LOOK AT ME, I’LL PERSONALLY PEEL YOUR EYELIDS BACK! SHUT UP! THE ONLY SOUND I WANT IS YOUR WEAK LITTLE HEARTS TRYING NOT TO GIVE OUT!”

I followed the order, pressing my forehead against the cool metal of the pill case in my hands, the stiff brim of my uniform cap digging into my wrist. My sensitive ears, pinned flat beneath the cap, rang with the volume, every shout a physical slap. He did not single me out; the storm was democratic, brutal, and all-encompassing.

“YOU ARE NOTHING! YOU ARE WORTHLESS! YOU WILL DO WHAT YOU ARE TOLD, WHEN YOU ARE TOLD, HOW YOU ARE TOLD! YOUR GEAR IS YOUR ONLY FRIEND! GET IT BETWEEN YOUR LEGS! HUG IT! LOVE IT! IT’S THE ONLY THING THAT MIGHT SAVE YOUR MISERABLE LIFE!”

The bus echoed with the sounds of scrambling, of duffels being wrestled into positions, of panicked, held breaths. The DI’s boots crunched past my red-taped seat without pause. I was just another recruit in fatigues with her head down, obeying. The anonymity of the abuse was, perversely, a relief.

The Shark Attack lasted the entire final half-hour of the journey. By the time the bus crunched to a halt on gravel, the silence that replaced the shouting felt hollow and ringing. My neck ached. My hands were numb from gripping the case.

“OFF MY BUS! NOW! MOVE, MOVE, MOVE! FORM A LINE ON THE YARD! DUFFELS AT YOUR FEET! EYES FRONT! MOVE LIKE YOUR LIVES DEPEND ON IT, BECAUSE STARTING TODAY, THEY DO!”

Recruits stumbled into the aisle, their uniforms rumpled, their movements jerky with residual fear. I waited, as instructed, until the bus was nearly empty. Then I stood, adjusting my cap, slinging my duffel, clutching the metal case.

I was the last one down the steps. The scene on the yard was one of shell-shocked recruits trying to form lines under the blistering shouts of three drill instructors. One of them, a mountain of a man with a shaved scalp and the same voice that had led the Shark Attack, saw me. His eyes, taking in the uniform, the case, my position, held no personal malice—only the flat, assessing glare he’d give any piece of irregular equipment on his manifest.

“RENAYA!” he bellowed. Not a taunt, a designation. “The attachment! You don’t get in line! You stand there!” He pointed to a spot ten feet to the left of the ragged formation, his gesture as precise as a surveyor’s. “You are a shadow! You follow all training, but you are not of this platoon! Understood?”

“Understood, Drill Sergeant!” I shouted, the words raw in my throat. I marched to the spot, dropped my duffel, snapped to attention, the metal case held rigidly at my side. The stiff fabric of my trousers felt taut across my back.

He gave me one final, impersonal glance—a commander confirming a logistical detail—then turned his full, terrifying focus back to the main platoon. “WHAT ARE YOU STARING AT, MAGGOTS? YOUR JOB IS TO LEARN, NOT GAPE! EYES FRONT!”

I stared straight ahead, over the heads of the identically dressed recruits, at the stark, grey wall of the nearest barracks building. The cool metal of the case bit into my palm through my uniform glove. The Shark Attack’s adrenaline was still buzzing in my veins, mixing uneasily with the pill's artificial calm.
