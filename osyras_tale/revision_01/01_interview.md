Chapter 1 - Interview

Hey. My name is Osyra. This is my video application.

(I hold up a piece of paper. It bleaches the screen, a stark rectangle in the dark of my room. The hood of my sweatshirt is up; the light from my monitor glints off my round glasses and the curve of my cheekbone, leaving the rest of my face in deep shadow.)

I grew up rich. With the kind of parents who chased status like a drug. They decided I was supposed to be a prodigy—a microbiology prodigy. One of those fancy-pants people who stops pandemics. It didn’t matter that I struggled. It didn’t matter what I wanted.

They had a… different approach to education. Our home labs were better equipped than most universities. I was their first and most devoted student. And when theory wasn’t enough, when they needed to see how the work interacted with a complex mammalian system…

(A long pause. I look down, a sweep of dark hair falling past my glasses, then back into the lens, my expression flat.)

I was the most convenient subject in the house.

They called it progressive, immersive science. They had charts of my development, my reflexes, my cellular response. Their magnum opus was never going to be a published paper.

(I take a slow, steadying breath, my eyes—a sharp, unnatural red even in the low light—locked on the camera. My hands, which have been resting on the desk, come up. They grasp the sides of the hood of my brown jacket.)

It was a daughter.

(In one fluid motion, I pull the hood back. My long black hair spills out. And there, rising from the crown of my head, alert and velvety-black, are a pair of pointed wolf ears. They twitch once, as if adjusting to the cool air of the room.)

Engineered by their serum.

Chimera 9.

(A slight, wry smile touches my lips, devoid of any warmth.)

I believe this covers the 'unique biological modifications' bullet point from your email.

(The video ends. The final frame holds for a moment: my red eyes staring out from the screen, the dark fur of my wolf ears stark against my black hair. The image blinks out, replaced by two words on a black background: UPLOAD COMPLETE.)

I sit back in my chair. The room is silent except for the faint hum of my computer. The glow of the monitor is the only light, painting the edges of my hood, my desk, the empty mug. Five minutes pass. I don’t move.

Then, a soft, digital chime. A new notification slides into the corner of my screen.

(I click it. The darkness of my room is replaced by the bright white of a new email. The text is crisp, impersonal. I read it, my eyes tracing each clinical line.)

FROM: Miranda Vasquez, MD <m.vasquez@titanreach.com>
SUBJECT: RE: Video Application - Verification Required
SENT: Tonight, 21:17

Applicant Osyra,

Your submission has been received and reviewed.

The nature of the presented physiological claims necessitates a preliminary verification to rule out digital or practical artifice before formal consideration can proceed.

You are required to attend a brief, live video conference at 09:00 tomorrow (your local time). You must present yourself exactly as you appeared in your submitted recording—same environment, same attire. You will be asked to perform simple visual confirmations at my direction.

Confirmation of your attendance is required within the hour.

If verification is satisfactory, you will be scheduled for a comprehensive clinical evaluation at our facility. This on-site evaluation serves as the final stage of the interview process.

This is a procedural necessity.

Miranda Vasquez, MD
Medical Screening Director
Titan Reach Consulting

(Below her signature is a block of text: a secured Zoom link and an alphanumeric passcode. The characters look sharp, final. A set of digital keys to a door I just asked someone to open.)

I stare at the words procedural necessity. My tail, curled around the leg of my chair, gives a single, slow twitch. The email offers no greeting, no reaction to what I showed them. Just the next step. The next test.

My fingers hover over the keyboard. The cursor blinks in the reply field. Outside my window, the city lights glow, indifferent.

I hit reply. I type a single word.

Confirmed.

I send it.

(The screen dims to black again, leaving only the faint, green pulse of the power light on my computer, like a slow, steady heartbeat in the dark.)

***

(I don’t sleep much. The kind of tired that sits behind your eyes and hums in my bones. My ears keep tuning into the wrong things—the drip of a tap, the scuttle of something in the walls, the low-frequency thrum of the city that never stops. When I do drift off, it’s not into dreams, but into a replay of sensations: the cold press of a stethoscope, the bite of a needle, my father’s voice noting observations in a flat, delighted tone. I wake up before my alarm, the grey dawn light seeping around the edges of my blinds. My hood is still up.)

At 08:55, I’m back in my chair. The dark room. The computer’s glow. I’ve cleared my desk, leaving only the monitor and the camera. I click the link.

The Zoom window opens. It’s just me in a small square, and a larger, empty black square labeled ‘Dr. Vasquez – Titan Reach.’ No picture. No voice. For a full minute, there’s nothing. Then her square lights up.

She’s not what I expected. Younger. Sharp features, dark hair pulled into a severe bun, glasses that reflect the light of her own screen so I can’t see her eyes. She’s in a white lab coat over a black turtleneck. Her background is a blur of sleek, grey office.

“Osyra,” she says. Her voice is the same as her email. Cool. Precise. A diagnostic tool. “Confirm your environment is identical to that of your submission.”

I pan my camera slowly, showing the dark walls, the empty desk. “It is.”

“Good. Posture, please. Sit up straight. Remove your hood.”

My hand hesitates for a fraction of a second at the edge of the fabric. Then I pull it back. My hair falls loose. My ears, freed, pivot forward, tensing towards the speaker of my laptop. I see her gaze lock onto them on her screen. She doesn’t comment.

“Shoulders,” she commands. “I need to observe the integration at the trapezius and cervical spine. Rotate them. Forward, then back in a full, slow circle.”

It feels absurd. Like a warm-up for a workout video. But I do it. I roll my shoulders forward, feeling the muscle move under my skin, then back in a wide circle. My tail, out of frame, flicks once in irritation.

“Again. Slower.”

I comply. The silence on her end is total, except for the faint tap of a keyboard.

“Now, touch your right ear. The outer cartilage. Pinch it gently and pull it forward. Hold it.”

A hot flash of humiliation burns in my chest. This is worse than the pointless shoulder rotations. This is a direct, deliberate manipulation of the part of me that is most not human. My hand feels clumsy as I reach up. The fur is soft, the cartilage springy under my fingers. I pull it forward. It feels grotesque, like showing a wound.

“Hold for five seconds. Release. Now the left.”

I do it. My ears flatten back against my skull of their own accord the moment I let go.

“Eyes,” she says. “Look directly into the camera. Without moving your head, track my finger.”

A slender finger enters the frame of her video, moving slowly left, then right, then up, then in a diagonal. My eyes follow. The red of my irises must be blazing in the dark-room feed.

“Pupillary response appears normal. Non-standard pigmentation confirmed,” she murmurs, more to herself than to me. “Final check. Bare your teeth for the camera. Canines specifically.”

I pull my lips back. A snarl I don’t feel. The points of my teeth catch the light.

A pause. More typing.

“Satisfactory,” Dr. Vasquez says finally. The word isn’t praise. It’s a stamp. “The preliminary verification is complete. We are authorizing the in-person clinical.”

She leans slightly closer to her camera. “Report to the Titan Reach biomedical facility on 12th Avenue. Can you be there for a full-body physical evaluation at 14:00 today?”

Two o’clock. Today. No time to think. No time to back out.

“It’s a comprehensive panel. Blood work, advanced imaging, stress-testing of the modified physiognomy. Consider it a freshening up of your baseline data before field consideration.”

Field consideration. The words hang there. My ticket out. My leash.

“Is 14:00 acceptable?” she repeats, a hint of steel in the calm.

My throat is dry. I manage a single, stiff nod.

“Verbal confirmation, please.”

“Yes,” I say, the word scraping out. “Two is fine.”

“Good. An appointment confirmation and pass for the front desk will be sent to this email. Do not be late.”

Her video square goes black. The meeting ends.

I’m left staring at my own reflection in the dark monitor. My ears are still pinned back. My shoulders ache from the pointless rotations. The humiliating, precise commands still echo in the quiet room.

They just wanted to see if the puppet’s strings were attached. Now, they want to see how much weight it can hold.

The clock on my screen reads 09:07. I have less than five hours until I report to my next examination.

***

The lobby of the Titan Reach biomedical facility was all muted steel and frosted glass. It smelled of industrial cleaner and recycled air. The woman at the desk scanned my pass with a bored expression, handed me a stack of forms and a clear plastic cup, and pointed down a hall. "First door on the left. Fill the cup halfway, leave it in the wall cabinet. Then change into the gown in the waiting area. Open in back."

The first room was small and brutally functional. A toilet, a sink, a metal cabinet with a numbered slot. The instructions were laminated. I did as I was told, the ritual humiliating in its banality. In the adjacent waiting area, a curtained alcove held a thin cotton gown. I shed my clothes, my ears flattening at the exposure. The gown did nothing to cover my tail, which I had to thread through the special opening, the tip twitching nervously against my calf.

The main waiting room had a few other people in similar gowns. Two guys, maybe early twenties, sat slouched in plastic chairs. They had the close-cropped hair and wary stillness of military recruits.

"…they say it's just depth perception," one muttered, not looking at the other. "But my cousin went through, he said they're checking for latent psychic resonance. The 'third eye' test, he called it."

"Bull," the other grunted, picking at his thumbnail. "It's micro-expressions. They're weeding out sociopaths. Friend of a friend failed it, got flagged for 'empathy deficiency.'"

I slid into a chair as far from them as possible, pulling my gown tighter. Their conspiracy theories were just nervous chatter, but in this sterile place, they felt like fragments of a stranger, more paranoid truth. A truth that had nothing on mine. I kept my head down, my hood of hair a poor curtain.

A nurse with a tablet called my name. She didn’t blink at the ears. "Osyra. This way."

She led me into a long, brightly lit hallway with multiple doors. This was the processing line. The first stop was a tiny booth where a technician took my blood pressure, then drew vial after vial of blood, the glass filling with dark liquid. "Hydration scan next," she said, handing me a towel for the crook of my arm.

The scan room was cold. I stood on a platform while a ring of light passed over me. "Arms out, please. Hold still." A digital hum, a flicker on a monitor showing a wireframe of my body. The technician’s eyes darted from the screen to my head, my tail, back to the screen. He said nothing.

From there, it was the coordination room. A different nurse, younger, with Dr. Vasquez observing from the corner, her arms crossed. "Please walk heel-to-toe along this line." I did. "Now, on your toes only." I rose, my tail extending for perfect balance. "Now your heels." A shuffle. "Good. Now, touch your finger to your nose. Eyes closed." My finger found its mark unerringly. My hearing tracked the slight shift of Vasquez’s weight on the floor.

"Now," Vasquez said, her voice cutting through the quiet. "Jump. From a standing start. As high as you can."

I bent my knees and pushed off. The ceiling tiles rushed at my face. I landed soft, knees bending perfectly. No sound.

"Ground reaction force must be exceptional," the young nurse breathed.

"Proceed," Vasquez snapped.

It was a blur of small rooms and specific, bizarre commands. A hearing booth where I had to raise a hand at tones so high the technician kept checking his equipment. A vision test where I read lines of letters, then had to identify shapes on a depth-perception panel. "Now track the light without moving your head." The penlight moved; my eyes followed, my ears unconsciously angling toward the motion. I heard Vasquez make a note.

Finally, I was led into a larger examination room. It held an exam table, an ultrasound machine, and a tray of instruments. Dr. Vasquez entered, followed by a younger doctor, Chen, who couldn't stop staring.

"Ms. Osyra," Vasquez said. "We'll begin the musculoskeletal and specific integument assessment."

It was an hour of directed movement. "Full spinal extension. Hold." I arched back. "Plantar flexion to maximum." I rose onto my toes. "Now, rapid directional changes. Follow the laser." For ten minutes, I lunged and pivoted after a red dot, the paper on the floor shredding under my bare feet. My body performed with a cruel efficiency. Just like Dad’s logs. Page 42: 'Subject demonstrates exceptional lumbar pliability...'

Chen approached with a handheld scanner. "May I?" he asked, hovering near my ears. I nodded stiffly. He scanned. "Dense cartilage, fully integrated." He produced a clicker. Click. Behind me. My left ear swiveled back instantly. Click. To the side. Both ears pinned the location. Humiliation burned hot under my skin.

"Auditory range is significantly extended," Chen reported.

"Eyes," Vasquez commanded. The bright ophthalmoscope light hit me. I stared into it, letting the red in my irises burn. "Pigmentation is structural. Probable superior low-light vision."

"Tail mobility and strength."

This was the worst. I had to lift a small weight with it, swish it through specific arcs, demonstrate its counterbalance during a one-legged stance. The muscles at the base of my spine burned with a familiar shame.

"Fascinating. A fully functional mechanism," Chen murmured to Vasquez, as if I were a piece of engineering.

After what felt like an eternity of pokes, scans, and measurements, Vasquez gave a curt nod. "The physical is concluded. We will now move to the final portion of the evaluation." She glanced at Chen. "Doctor, you may go. Send in Dr. Ellen."

Chen left, and a moment later, a woman in her forties entered. She had a calm, competent air and carried a new tablet. "Hello, Osyra. I'm Dr. Ellen. This part is standard for all applicants, but given your unique physiology, we need to establish a complete reproductive baseline."

The dread was immediate and cold. This was the part their notes had been most feverish about. *Cyclical stability. Hormonal integration.*

She began with a standard physical exam—heart rate, palpation of my abdomen. Her hands were professional, but when she pressed near my ovaries, a jolt went through me, a deep internal resonance. She paused, her gaze sharpening. "Interesting."

The internal ultrasound was next. The cold gel, the intrusive probe. I stared at a crack in the ceiling tile. On the screen, grey shapes swirled—my own insides, looking alien.

"Uterine structure appears normal," Dr. Ellen said quietly. "Ovarian activity is… significant. Follicular development is advanced."

She removed the probe and sat on a stool, facing me. Her expression was neutral, open. "Osyra, I need you to describe your reproductive cycle for me. In your own words. What do you experience?"

The question was a blade. I’d never had to say it out loud. "It’s… not a period," I started, the distinction clawing its way out. "No blood. It’s a wave. It builds. My senses get painfully sharp. I smell electricity, minerals in concrete. I get a fever. My skin feels like a sunburn."

"And the peak?"

I looked away. "The peak is the heat. It’s a… biological command. A deep, physical drawing sensation. The urge is overwhelming. It’s all I can feel for days. Then it breaks, and I crash. It happens every three to four months. It’s getting more frequent."

She nodded, typing. "You’re describing a textbook estrous cycle. Driven by a non-human hormonal protocol. The Chimera serum rewired your hypothalamic-pituitary axis." She leaned forward slightly. "These drives could sharpen your instincts in the field to an extraordinary degree. But uncontrolled, they are a profound liability."

She wasn't judging. She was assessing a flawed asset. "Given Titan Reach’s operational parameters, we will provide a regimen of hormonal regulators. Non-negotiable for field readiness. The prescription and a monitoring kit will be couriered to you."

A chemical leash for the biological one. To make me docile, predictable.

"Understood," I said, the word ash.

Dr. Ellen stood. "Your body is operating on their schedule, Osyra. We’re just helping you keep time." She gave a professional nod and left.

Dr. Vasquez re-entered, looking from her clipboard to me. Her clinical detachment had hardened into verification. Conquest. "The Chimera 9 expression is valid and fully integrated. You have passed the final interview."

I dressed in the empty curtained alcove, yanking my hoodie on, pulling the hood up the second it cleared my head. The clinic's smell was in my nose, on my skin. No relief. Just a hollow echo.

Passed. I’d graduated from my parents’ lab to a bigger, better-funded cage. The tests were over.

Somehow, that felt like the worst possible outcome.

***

A week passed. The couriered package arrived: a blister pack of pills and a clinical-grade basal thermometer. I left it on my kitchen counter, untouched. A tiny rebellion. Every itch, every heightened smell, I monitored with a dread that curdled into a perverse defiance. *This is still mine.*

The heat hit two weeks after the exam. It wasn't a surprise; it was an ambush I’d chosen. The low ache in my bones sharpened into a furnace by dusk. My apartment was a torture chamber of amplified sensation—the fridge motor a jackhammer, the scent of my own anxiety sour and overwhelming. The courier’s pills gleamed mockingly from the counter. Taking them felt like letting them win. Not taking them felt like insanity.

The restlessness was a live wire. I couldn’t be contained. I fled to the only space left: the roof.

The night air was cool against my burning skin. The city sprawled below, a map of smells and distant sounds. I paced the gravel, my tail lashing, my ears swiveling at every distant siren, every shout from the streets. The need was a physical pressure, a hollow, pulling throb deep in my core. It was maddening.

That’s when I caught his scent.

It cut through the chemical haze of the city—clean soap, fresh linen, and underneath, something warm and vital. Human, but… distinct. Compelling. My head snapped up. He was at the far end of the roof, leaning against the parapet, looking out at the skyline. Just a silhouette.

My body moved before my mind could catch up. The need focused, honed in on that scent like a beacon. I was across the roof without deciding to go, the gravel crunching under my boots.

He turned as I approached. He was tall, with kind eyes that widened in surprise, then cautious curiosity as he took me in—the hood, the ears visible in the moonlight, the agitated tail. Most people ran. Or screamed. He just… watched.

His eyes moved from my pinned ears to my fever-bright gaze, and his expression shifted from curiosity to a dawning, careful comprehension. He didn’t look at my ears like they were costumes, but like they were… symptoms. “You’re… in some kind of trouble,” he stated softly. It wasn’t a question about what I was, but about the state I was in.

“You shouldn’t be up here alone,” I said, my voice a rough scrape. It wasn’t a warning. It was a confession.

“Neither should you,” he replied. His voice was calm. A deep, steady sound that vibrated in my chest. “I’m Leo. I live downstairs.”

I stopped a few feet away, close enough that his scent washed over me, spicy and real. The animal part of me screamed to press closer, to rub my cheek against his jacket, to taste the salt on his skin. I locked my knees to stay still.

“Osyra,” I managed.

He nodded, his gaze dropping to my twitching ears, then back to my eyes. He didn’t flinch from the red. He saw the fever in my gaze, the tremor that wasn’t from cold. He glanced from my pleading eyes to the city far below, and something in his face softened with decision, not fear.

“What do you need?” he asked, the question simple and devastating.

I didn’t have an answer that wasn’t primal, instinctual. *Contact. Pressure. You.*

Instead, I reached out, slowly, giving him every chance to pull back. My fingertips brushed the back of his hand where it rested on the concrete ledge. The spark of contact was electric, a jolt that straightened my spine. His skin was cool. My whole world narrowed to that point of connection.

He turned his hand, palm up. An invitation. Or a surrender.

I slid my fingers against his, twining them together. His grip was firm, steadying. The simple touch was a floodgate. The frantic, scattered energy in me coalesced, flowed toward that anchor point. The painful edge of the need blunted, not gone, but… channeled. Focused.

We stood there in the dark, hand in hand, not speaking. The city noise faded to a murmur. My breathing slowed to match his. My ears, which had been flicking at every sound, relaxed, rotating gently toward the rhythm of his heartbeat. My tail stilled, curling softly around my own ankle.

It wasn’t passion. Not yet. It was something more fundamental. A quieting. A recognition. The beast in my blood, frantic and howling, saw him and… settled.

He lifted our joined hands, his thumb stroking a slow, deliberate line across my knuckles. The gesture was unbearably gentle. Human.

“Is this okay?” he whispered.

I leaned my forehead against his shoulder, hiding my face in the clean linen scent of his shirt. I nodded.

For the first time since the heat began, the cage wasn’t pressing in. The door wasn’t open, but the lock felt… less heavy. He held my hand in the dark, and for a little while, I was not a subject, or an applicant, or a monster.

I was just a girl on a rooftop, holding onto something warm, waiting for the fever to break.

I went inside. The ghost of Leo’s touch on my skin felt different now, under the sterile clarity of the receding heat. Not like a connection, but like a smudge. The Titan Reach pill kit sat on the counter, a stark, clinical answer to the mess I’d just made. *Non-negotiable for field readiness.* What a joke. I couldn’t manage a simple interaction on a rooftop.

With a grimace of self-loathing, I punched a pill through the foil. It was a small, white admission of failure. I’d gone up there to escape the frenzy, and what had I done? I’d dragged a random stranger into my chaos. I’d practically glued myself to him, some poor guy just trying to get some air. He’d been kind, which made it worse. He’d seen a girl in obvious distress and had been decent about it. He had no idea the distress was a engineered biological command, that I’d honed in on his scent like a predator. My skin crawled with the shame of it. Taking the pill wasn’t just about control for the future; it was an eraser for tonight.

I swallowed it dry, the bitter chalk taste a fitting punishment.

That night, the heat didn’t vanish, but its meaning changed. The raw need was still a persistent thrum in my blood, but the frantic, compulsive narrative was gone. The memory of leaning against him, of twining my fingers with his, played in my head not as a moment of solace, but as a cringe-inducing lapse in judgment. *What was I thinking?* I hadn’t been. That was the whole problem. I fell asleep wrapped in a cold blanket of regret, the arousal now just a dull, physiological echo, stripped of all its dangerous illusion.

Morning brought a brutal clarity. The mental fog was gone, burned away by the chemical regulator. With it went the last vestiges of the heat’s romantic lie. In the crisp, quiet light of day, I saw the rooftop for what it was: a vulnerable, potentially catastrophic mistake. Leo wasn’t a point of quiet humanity; he was a variable. An unknown. A random dude who now had a very strange story to tell, if he chose to. My ears flattened against my skull as I replayed it. The neediness. The trembling. Offering my name like it was a gift, when it was just another piece of data I’d stupidly handed over.

A cold, sharp peace cut through me. This was the clarity I needed. This was how I had to move forward. No more messing with randoms. No more allowing the animal inside to dictate my interactions. The pill gave me the silence to hear my own priorities, and they were singular: survive, get control, get out of this life. Anything else was a liability.

The placid, emotionless days that followed were a relief. I was a closed system again. I left the pill bottle alone, monitoring the steady, artificial calm.

Then, the phone rang.

***

The manufactured quiet was shattered by a single phone call. It didn’t come from a blocked number. It came with a title.

“This is Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Thorne, Joint Special Operations Personnel Division,” the voice said. It was a voice carved from granite, with the ghost of a southern drawl smoothing its edges. It held no warmth, only absolute authority. “I am contacting you on behalf of our private-sector liaison, Titan Reach Consulting.”

My grip tightened on the phone. I was sitting on my fire escape, but I felt miles away from the rooftop. My tail lay inert.

“They’ve forwarded your clinical evaluation package, Ms. Osyra. It’s… thorough. Dr. Vasquez’s notes indicate you possess a… unique aptitude profile.”

I heard the subtext clearly. *A controlled asset. Or a loose cannon.*

“Titan Reach has a proposal. They field operatives. You’ve passed the medical. Now you face the practical.”

The sun felt interrogative.

“They have a dedicated training curriculum at a secure facility. A final evaluation under simulated high-stress conditions. Think of it as a combine for people who hunt things that shouldn’t exist. If you pass, a formal job offer is guaranteed. Full benefits, structured pay, a defined role. A purpose.”

A purpose. A structure. Walls to replace the cage. Rules to prevent rooftop mistakes.

“And if I fail?” My voice was flat.

A pause. “Failure in this line of work has permanent consequences. But in the context of the evaluation, it means you walk away. No offer. Your file is closed. Titan Reach considers the matter concluded.”

*Concluded.* Either they’d forget me, or they’d ensure I was no longer a variable.

“What does it involve?”

“Need-to-know, delivered on-site. It will assess tactical acumen, threat response, team interoperability, and stress resilience under controlled exposures. All necessary equipment provided. You need only bring yourself.”

*And the discipline not to compromise yourself*, I thought, the memory of a stranger’s hand sharp in my mind.

“You have forty-eight hours to decide. An NDA will be transmitted. Sign it, and coordinates for transport will follow. Do not sign it, and this conversation never happened.”

The line died.

I sat in the fading light. The pills on my counter were proof I couldn’t trust my own biology. The rooftop was proof I couldn’t trust my judgment when it was compromised. Titan Reach offered a third option: outsource the trust. Surrender to a bigger, sharper system with clearer rules. They wouldn’t care about my regrets, only my performance.

The recruiter’s call was a lifeline thrown from the very ship that had designed my storm. It was the only play.

I went inside. The NDA glowed on my screen. I didn’t hesitate. The shame of my vulnerability with a random person was a sharper spur than any ambition.

I typed my name.

The screen refreshed. Coordinates. A time: 04:30. **Pack Light.**

I looked at the pills. I took one, ensuring the fog—and the poor decisions it bred—would stay far away. Then I went to find a bag. The only thing I needed to pack was the resolve not to be a mistake again.
