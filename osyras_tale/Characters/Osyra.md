#### **I. Physical Description**

- **Base Appearance (Pre-Accident):**
    
    - **Ethnicity/Race:** Ambiguous, likely mixed heritage; described as having "light brown skin."
        
    - **Hair:** Black, worn in a style that often falls into her face, used as a curtain between her and the world.
        
    - **Eyes:** Brown, capable of conveying deep annoyance, intelligence, and loneliness.
        
    - **Height/Build:** Tall for her age and gender, with a frame that feels awkward and conspicuous as a teen. She carries herself with a tension that oscillates between trying to shrink away and using her height to intimidate.
        
    - **Distinguishing Features:** None initially; her appearance is that of a "trophy" – healthy, whole, and aesthetically pleasing for her wealthy parents' social circle.
        
- **Altered Appearance (Post-Lab Accident):**
    
    - **Eyes:** Her most striking feature. Her brown eyes have been replaced with **"ominous red eyes"** that glow faintly in low light. This is a common marker of the accident's physiological impact.
        
    - **Overall Physiology:** The exact full extent is left ominous, but she is visibly and fundamentally altered. She refers to herself as a "thing" and a "creature." The transformation is not a set of clean "enhancements" but a grotesque deviation from the human form, making her appear monstrous to others and to herself. It was an **accident,** not a choice.

#### **II. Psychological & Emotional Profile**

- **Core Conflict:** A profound and desperate need for genuine acknowledgement and connection, warring with a deep-seated pride, intellectual arrogance, and a shattered sense of self after a traumatic accident.
    
- **Key Traits:**
    
    - **Intellectually Gifted:** Her intelligence was her primary identity and shield. It is also likely what led her to the lab where the accident occurred, making her relationship with her own mind deeply complicated.
        
    - **Fiercely Independent:** A byproduct of neglect. She believes she cannot rely on anyone and must solve her own problems. This is amplified post-accident, as she believes no one can understand her new reality.
        
    - **Socially Alienated:** She felt fundamentally separate from her peers. Post-accident, this alienation is absolute and physical. She is no longer just mentally apart from humanity; she is physically other.
        
    - **Repressed Rage:** Beneath her studious exterior was a cauldron of anger—at her parents' neglect and at societal injustice. Post-accident, this rage is now also directed at the cruel randomness of fate and her own powerlessness to reverse what happened.
        
    - **Prideful to a Fault:** Her greatest weakness. It prevented her from accepting kindness and now fuels her self-loathing. She sees herself as a "failed experiment" in a literal sense.
        
    - **Latent Protective Instinct:** Despite her alienation, she possesses a powerful, almost reflexive, drive to protect the vulnerable, as seen with Yuki the DJ. This is a core piece of her humanity that survives the accident.
        
- **Fatal Flaw:** Her pride and intellectual self-reliance, which initially prevented her from forming genuine connections, now prevent her from accepting her new form and seeking redemption. She believes her humanity was lost in the accident, rather than transformed.

#### **III. Background & Circumstances**

- **Financial Status:** Extreme wealth. She lived in a "massive estate," a "mansion on the hill." This wealth likely funded her education and potentially the high-tech, risky environment where the lab accident occurred. It is now a bitter reminder of a life she can no longer access.
    
- **Family Dynamics:**
    
    - **Parents:** Ghosts. They were physically absent and emotionally neglectful. Their reaction to her accident is not stated, but it can be inferred that it further fractured their relationship, likely leading to her current isolated state with only an android for company.
        
    - **Derran (The Butler):** The closest figure to a parent. His memory is a touchstone for the kindness she felt she never deserved. His absence in her current life is keenly felt.
        
- **The Lab Accident:** A pivotal, life-shattering event. The specifics are unknown, but it was unintended and catastrophic, mutating her body and severing her from her old life. It re-contextualizes her line in Chapter 2: _"I couldn't help but wonder why I didn't know more about the tech I used every day."_ This curiosity, taken to a professional extreme, ultimately led to her downfall.

#### **IV. Motivations & Beliefs**

- **Core Motivation (Teens):** To earn her parents' love and attention through academic and intellectual achievement.
    
- **Core Motivation (Adult):** To grapple with the trauma of the accident and its aftermath. She is on a quest to answer the question, _"Vanity... am I a monster?"_ She is trying to reconcile her unchanged inner self with her horrifically changed exterior.
    
- **Religious/Philosophical Stance:** No explicit religious belief is shown. She is now entrenched in an existential crisis, forced to question the very definitions of humanity, identity, and purpose from the outside looking in.
    
- **View of Self (Teens):** A lonely, misunderstood genius surrounded by inferiors. A "ghost" in her own life.
    
- **View of Self (Adult):** A "monster," a "creature," and a victim of a terrible accident. She views her current state as a punishment or a tragic mistake, warping the person she once was.

#### **V. Skills & Abilities**

- **Academic/Scientific Prowess:** Exceptional, particularly in the sciences (Biology). A strategic and analytical mind that was likely at a professional level before the accident.
    
- **Violent Capability:** When her protective rage is triggered, she is capable of swift, brutal, and efficient violence. This trait from her youth now exists within a body that is likely physically more powerful and intimidating.
    
- **Resilience:** The capacity to endure immense physical and psychological trauma and continue existing, even when she feels there is no hope left.

**Summary Arc:** Osyra's journey is from a state of **Neglected Privilege** to **Violent Awakening** (the club incident), to **Traumatic Transformation** (the lab accident), and finally, a painful struggle for **Self-Redefinition**. She is a tragic figure whose search for meaning through intellect led to her physical undoing, forcing her to discover that her humanity was never in her appearance, but in her memories, her actions, and her capacity for protection and connection.
