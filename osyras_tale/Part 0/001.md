[Osyra](Osyra.md)

The air in the alley was a thick, permanent soup of damp cardboard, old dye, and despair. Osyra’s world was a nest of discarded finery—scraps of velvet from a winter collection, torn poly-blend shirts, and a flattened mattress of shopping bags that rustled with every shallow breath she took in her sleep. This was her kingdom, the leeward side of a luxury department store’s dumpster.

Dawn came not with a gentle light, but as a slow, grimy seep through the canyon of brick and concrete. The sun didn't so much rise as it managed to stain the higher windows a faint orange. Around her, the other residents of the alley began to stir. A man they called Rusty coughed, a wet, rattling sound that was part of the morning chorus. Another figure shifted in a cocoon of newspaper, mumbling in their sleep.

Osyra was already awake behind her round glasses, eyes closed, listening. She heard the scuttle of a rat, the distant growl of the city’s first traffic, the uneven breath of the man three nests over. She was playing a part, and a good actor never breaks character until the curtain call.

Her curtain call was a harsh, electronic buzz from the pocket of her brown, hooded jacket.

The sound was violently out of place. Eyes flicked open around the alley. Rusty’s coughing stopped mid-rattle. The figure in the newspaper went still.

Osyra didn’t jump. She moved with a slow, deliberate weariness that was only half-feigned. She sat up, the oversized hood of her jacket falling forward, obscuring her face and the swept bangs of her long black hair in a shadowy cowl. She fished out the cheap, rugged-looking phone, its screen blazing with a single word: HANDLER.

She took a breath, the kind someone takes before stepping into cold water, and answered. She said nothing.

A voice, clipped, digital, and devoid of any humanity, came through the speaker. “Open line. Disclose call sign for verification.”

The silence in the alley was absolute now. Even the city seemed to hold its breath. These people knew trouble. They knew the sound of authority, even a strange, metallic one like this. They knew better than to eavesdrop, but fear kept them frozen.

Osyra’s voice, when it came, was small and tight with a nervousness that wasn’t entirely an act. “Chimera One.”

The voice on the other end didn’t miss a beat. “Acknowledged, Chimera One. Signal is live and stable. Your extended period of non-contact is noted. Playtime is over. Proceed to rendezvous point Gamma for extraction and debrief. Confirm.”

Osyra’s hood tilted down slightly. “Confirmed.”

The line went dead.

For a moment, nothing changed. She was just a stray who’d gotten a very weird call. Then she moved. In one fluid motion, she was on her feet, a languid, cat-like stretch arching her back. The nervous stray was gone, replaced by a creature of coiled purpose.

She didn’t look at any of them. Instead, she knelt by her bed of trash, her hands sliding beneath the pile of fabric and bags. There was a scrape of metal on concrete. With a grunt of effort, she hauled her hidden treasure into the open morning air.

It was a rifle. But not just any rifle. It was a beast of blackened steel and polished wood, long and brutal-looking, with a barrel thick enough to scare a tank. A .50 caliber anti-material rifle, a weapon designed to punch through engine blocks, not something you find in a dumpster behind a clothing store.

A collective, sharp intake of breath hissed through the alley. Rusty took a step back, his eyes wide. The person in the newspaper finally emerged, a young woman with dirt-smudged cheeks, her mouth hanging open.

Osyra finally turned to face them. With her free hand, she reached up and pushed back her hood.

Her long black hair was tied back in a practical but messy ponytail. Two wolf ears, covered in the same dark fur, twitched once, flicking away the confines of the fabric. They stood erect and alert. Behind her round glasses, her eyes, a striking and unsettling shade of red, scanned the stunned faces of her audience. Her brown skin was smudged with dirt, a perfect part of her disguise.

She worked at the knot of the jacket tied around her waist, letting it fall to the ground to reveal the light yellow shirt beneath. The motion freed the bushy, grey wolf’s tail that had been tucked and hidden, and it gave a single, dismissive swish.

She was no longer just a strange girl with a giant gun. She was something else entirely.

She hefted the colossal rifle onto her shoulder as if it were a twig. Her red eyes held them all for a moment. “This,” she said, her voice now low, clear, and laced with an unmistakable threat of command, “will be our secret.”

Before any of them could even think to form a word, to nod or protest, she was gone. She took off at a sprint, a blur of fur, brown jacket, and black steel that leaped onto a fire escape and vanished over the roofline with impossible speed.

The alley was left in a silence louder than any noise.

Rusty was the first to speak, his voice a bare whisper. “Did… did you see that?”

The young woman who’d been wrapped in newspaper stared at the spot where the wolf-eared girl had stood. “She had a tail,” she breathed, as if saying it any louder would make it less real. “And a cannon. And… red eyes.”

The rumors began before her footsteps had even faded from the rooftop above. They would grow and mutate with each retelling in the days that followed—a ghost story for the destitute, a tale of a wolf-girl angel, or demon, who slept among them, guarding some hellish treasure. But in that moment, they all shared the same, stunned look. They had all kept a secret they never asked for, and their world, for all its grim reality, had suddenly become a much, much stranger place.
