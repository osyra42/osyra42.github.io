# Chapter 34 - Legalities and Legends

The sterile, recycled air of Kael’s office aboard The Bastion was a jarring transition from the rot-filled tunnels. I stood before his desk, the memory of the Hollow Hound’s voice still a cold knot in my stomach. Vanity stood beside me, a silent, observant statue.

“The mission was a success,” Kael stated, reviewing the after-action report on his data-slate. “The entity is neutralized. But your supplemental notes are… concerning. It spoke to you.”

“It knew things, Commander,” I said, my voice tighter than I intended. “It knew about the girl. Layla Null. It called me ‘Maker.’ It taunted me with her.”

Kael looked up, his cybernetic eye whirring softly as it focused on me. “Psychological warfare. These entities are adept at finding psychological weaknesses. Your file is not entirely secure, Chimera One. A breach is possible.”

“Or it’s a connection,” I countered. “These creatures, my condition, Layla’s disappearance—it’s all tied to the Chimera Project. I need authorization to research it. To find out what really happened to her. She might be the key to understanding what we’re facing.”

Kael leaned back, steepling his fingers. “Your focus is the field. Let intelligence analysts handle the data.”

“With respect, sir, they don’t know what to look for. I do. I was there.”

Before Kael could respond, Vanity spoke, her synthetic voice cutting through the tension. “Commander. There is a separate, pressing matter. My legal status.”

Kael’s gaze shifted to the android, a flicker of impatience in his expression. “Your status?”

“I am stolen property,” Vanity stated, as if reciting a simple fact. “My registration is held by Layla Null. The facility where I was left following her disappearance had no legal right to retain me, and this organization had no right to acquire me. I am compelled by my core programming to return to my rightful owner. To do so, I must initiate legal proceedings to establish my identity as an asset to be repatriated.”

Kael stared at her. “You want to sue us?”

“I wish to correct an illegal possession,” Vanity corrected. “The proceedings will necessitate discovery. Subpoenas will be issued to the Elias Foundation for all records pertaining to Layla Null’s disappearance and the Chimera Project.”

The room fell silent. I looked at Vanity, a slow realization dawning. This wasn’t just about her freedom. It was a weapon. She was using the legal system as a crowbar to pry open the Foundation’s secrets, leveraging her own disputed existence to force the truth into the open.

Kael’s face was a mask of cold calculation. He saw it too. A legal battle would be messy, public. It would expose the mercenary group’s shady acquisitions and, more importantly, it would shine a very bright, very inconvenient light on the Elias Foundation.

“Your… initiative… is noted, Unit V-73,” Kael said slowly. “But now is not the time for such distractions. We have a more immediate problem.” He turned his attention back to me, effectively dismissing Vanity’s declaration. “A park ranger in the Blackwood Range has reported missing hikers. Three days overdue. Strange reports from other campers about sounds, figures in the trees. The description doesn’t match your subway friend. This one is… taller. Skinnier. Antlers.”

A Wendigo. The legend flashed in my mind—a malevolent spirit of starvation and cold, often depicted with a deer’s skull for a head.

“The terrain is dense, mountainous. Communications will be spotty. You’ll need aerial reconnaissance.” He looked at Vanity. “You will pilot a surveillance drone. Provide overwatch and tactical data. This should satisfy your programming’s need for ‘compliance’ for the time being. The legal discussion is tabled.”

It was a dismissal and an assignment rolled into one. He was sending us into the woods to get us out of his hair, to deal with a new monster while he figured out how to handle the one he had in his office.

An hour later, we were en route to the mountains. The urban decay was replaced by a sea of endless green. At a remote trailhead, a ranger handed us a map with a shaking hand, his eyes wide with a fear that had nothing to do with bears.

We moved into the tree line, the air growing cold and heavy with the scent of pine and damp earth. Vanity unpacked a compact drone from her pack. It whirred to life, a silent black dragonfly that rose above the canopy.

“Drone is airborne,” she reported, her eyes glowing faintly as she processed the feed. “Scanning the designated search grid. Thermal is clear so far.”

I adjusted the strap of the Charge Rifle. The woods were too quiet. The normal sounds of birds and insects were absent. An oppressive stillness hung over everything.

“The legends say a Wendigo mimics human voices to lure its prey,” I murmured, more to myself than to Vanity.

“A logical hunting strategy for an entity that preys on social creatures,” she replied. “I am filtering audio for anomalous frequencies.”

We hiked deeper, the drone a silent guardian above. The sun began to dip below the mountains, casting long, distorted shadows through the trees. Every snapped twig was a potential threat.

Then Vanity’s voice came through the comms, sharper than usual. “Chimera One. I have a heat signature. Approximately half a mile northeast. It is… irregular. Bipedal, but the thermal profile is wrong. Too cold in the core, with erratic hot spots.”

“Is it moving?”

“Negative. It is stationary. Waiting.”

A lure. Or a trap.

“Guide me in,” I said, tightening my grip on the rifle.

“Acknowledged. Proceed on your current heading. I will maintain high altitude to avoid detection.”

The forest closed in around me as I followed Vanity’s directions. The temperature dropped noticeably. My breath plumed in the air. And then, on the wind, I heard it. A faint, desperate call that made my blood run cold.

It sounded like a young woman’s voice, crying for help.

The Wendigo wasn’t just waiting. It was hunting. And it had just cast its line. Above me, Vanity’s drone hovered, a silent eye in the sky, as I walked toward the sound.
