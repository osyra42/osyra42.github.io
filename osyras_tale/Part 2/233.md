# Chapter 33 - The Hollow Hound

The silence of the remote cabin was shattered two mornings later by the insistent chime of the secure terminal. The mission brief was terse. An abandoned subway system. Unexplained disappearances. Signs pointed to a biological entity.

Forty-eight hours later, I stand before a gaping subway entrance swallowed by snowdrifts. Vanity's voice is cool in my ear.

'Target designation: Hollow Hound. Canine morphology with necrotic traits. Intel suggests its presence induces profound dread. There is an unconfirmed report of... vocalization."

I assemble the Charge Rifle, the weight a familiar comfort. 'Vocalization?"

'A survivor claimed the entity spoke. Revealed knowledge it should not have possessed."

I chamber a tungsten spike. 'I'm going in." I cut the transmission.

My HUD glasses slide into place, transforming the black entrance into a glowing wireframe. 'Vanity, mark all incident locations."

Ghostly markers bloom on my display. The first site is a splash of blackened blood, the stench of metal and decay still fresh. The spatter pattern was wrong—a slow, seeping bleed. The edges of the stain were charred, the concrete crumbling from necrosis.

I follow the trail of glowing paw prints deeper. The walls were scarred with deliberate, testing slashes. A shredded jacket lay ahead, an arm still inside the sleeve, the flesh withered and mummified in moments.

A whisper of movement echoed. Not footsteps. Not breathing.

The sound of something wetly licking its teeth.

I turned, rifle raised, as a deep, rattling inhalation came from the darkness. The air shifted, overwhelmed by the stench of rancid meat and wet fur.

I advanced. My skin prickled, reading the air currents around a shifting mass. Twenty feet ahead. Circling.

Skittering. The sound vibrated through my bones.

'You are moving directly into its preferred flanking vector," Vanity noted.

A grim smile touched my lips. Let it try.

The creature inhaled again, a wet, guttural sound. I pivoted toward the noise.

It did not charge. It emerged from the shadows, a nightmare of stretched pale skin over too many joints. Its mouth, a ragged hole filled with yellowed fangs, did not snarl. It spoke. The voice was a low, rough scrape, like stones grinding together, dripping with disregarded arrogance.

'Little monster... come to clean up your mess?"

The words hit me with physical force. I froze, the rifle steady but my mind reeling. It wasn't a roar. It was speech.

'Where is the girl, Maker?" it hissed, the title a mockery. The one with fire for hair? What did you do with her?"

My blood ran cold. Layla. It couldn't know. Unless...

'Did you lose her?" it continued, taking a slow, stalking step forward. 'Or did you break her, like you break everything you touch? We smell your failure on you, Chimera. It is... delicious."

'Hold your position, Chimera One," Vanity's voice was urgent in my ear, a stark contrast to the demonic rasp filling the tunnel. 'Its vocalizations are a confirmed psychological weapon."

But it was too late. The words were claws in my psyche, digging at wounds that had never healed. My failures, my guilt, given a voice.

'She cries out, you know," the creature taunted, its milky eyes fixed on me. 'In the spaces between. She calls for the doctor who betrayed her. Do you hear her, too?"

A hot, sharp anger flared in my chest, cutting through the dread. The pressure built, a familiar wave. My skin grew slick with a cold sweat that carried the potent chemical trigger of my stress.

The creature's mocking advance faltered. Its arrogant posture slackened. The intelligence in its eyes glazed over, replaced by a placid confusion. It had forgotten its taunts. Forgotten I was a threat.

The moment of stillness was all I needed.

The shot was a concussive blast. The reticle had been centered between its eyes the entire time. The thing that had spoken with Layla's voice—whether a trick or some horrific truth—vanished in a spray of bone and necrotic tissue.

Gore rained against the tunnel walls. Silence returned, broken only by the drip of fluids.

'The target has been neutralized," Vanity stated after a moment.

I stood breathing heavily, not from exertion, but from the echo of its words. What did you do with her?

'Chimera One," Vanity's voice cut through the silence. 'Command requires operational callsign verification for the log."

The mundane request felt surreal. I swallowed, my throat dry. 'Chimera One."

'Identity confirmed. Mission logged and closed."

I ripped the earpiece out. The silence was absolute now, and in it, I heard only the creature's taunt. We smell your failure on you.

It hadn't just been trying to frighten me. It had been probing. It knew about Layla. And if one creature knew, others could. My failure wasn't just a ghost haunting my conscience; it was a beacon, drawing things from the darkness that knew my deepest sins. The hunt was no longer just about elimination. It was about interrogation. And the next thing that spoke to me in that rough, demonic voice might have real answers.The snow blurs the landscape into a monochrome nightmare—a coloring book page left unfinished, all stark blacks and bleached whites. A high-pitched chime rings in my earpiece. Incoming transmission.  
Vanity's voice, cool and synthetic, fills my ear: 'Current target is a dog-like entity with necrotic traits. Designation: Hollow Hound. It preys on isolated humans within its territory. Highly aggressive. Engage with extreme caution."  
I continue listening as I assemble my weapon—the Charge Rifle. My assistant, Vanity, and I designed it together with the help of some machinists back at the Foundation.  
My assistant's voice continues through the speaker: 'It seems to induce a type of dread just by being near. There's even one case where a survivor claims the thing talked to them."  
I unfold the barrel and lock it into place.  
'It told him about regrettable things he had done—things it should never have known."  
I load four tungsten spikes into the exaggerated magazine and chamber one.  
'Do you think the creature is possessed by a demon or something?"  
I flick the power on. An electrical whine barely reaches my ears for a moment before fading into silence.  
"I'm ready to go in," I said, cutting off the transmission mid-sentence.  
The glasses slid down from my forehead with practiced ease – my so-called "HUD Glasses" (naming things was never my strong suit). Twin cameras whirred to life, feeding data to Vanity's processors. In seconds, the lenses projected a wireframe overlay, transforming pitch black into a glowing blueprint of the subway tunnel. Movement would show up in pulsing highlights.  
I took my first step into the void.  
"Vanity, mark all sighting and death locations."  
"One moment." Her reply came instantaneously. Three seconds later, ghostly markers bloomed across my vision. "Complete."  
The closest death site glowed crimson just feet from the stairwell. He almost made it. No body remained – just a Rorschach blot of blackened blood and that coppery stench, somehow still fresh after who-knows-how-long.  
A soft yellow glow highlights each print, mapping a path through the hunting grounds. Most territorial entities like this operate in a predictable pattern—circling outward from their den. If I follow the trail, it'll lead me straight to the heart of its territory.  
I crouch beside the largest bloodstain, my HUD zooming in. The splatter is wrong—not arterial spray, not defensive wounds. The victim bled out slowly, as if their body forgot how to clot. The edges of the stain are blackened, tissue necrosis spreading outward like ink in water.  
Necrotic bite or scratch. Fast-acting.  
I press two fingers to the darkened concrete. Cold. Not just from the winter air—this is the unnatural chill of decay. My gloves come away dusted with a fine, ashen residue.  
"Vanity," I murmur, "scan for cellular degradation patterns."  
A pause. Then: "Tissue breakdown consistent with rapid-onset necrosis. Catalyzed by foreign enzymes. No known biological match."  
I follow the glowing paw prints deeper. The walls bear long, jagged grooves—claw marks, but not from struggle. These are deliberate, methodical. Like it was testing its own strength. The concrete around the grooves crumbles at the touch, brittle as dead bone.  
A shredded jacket lies ahead, half-buried in frost. The fabric is intact, but the sleeve is stiff with dried blood—and beneath it, the arm is still inside. Or what's left of it. The flesh is withered, mummified in seconds, fingers curled like roots left to rot.  
It doesn't just kill. It rots its victims alive.  
A whisper of movement echoes down the tunnel. Not footsteps. Not breathing.  
The sound of something licking its teeth.  
I turn, rifle raised—just as something in the dark inhales.  
Iron. Mold. Salt from sweat long dried into concrete. The scents hit in layers - a forensic roadmap of decay. But beneath them, clinging to the stale air: rancid meat and wet fur. The Hollow Hound's breath hangs thick, sweetly putrid like spoiled honey.  
My boots crush frozen rubble as I advance. No pause. No uncertainty. The HUD's markers flicker uselessly; I don't need augmented reality when my own skin maps the air currents swirling around the creature's bulk. Twenty-two feet northeast. Circling counterclockwise.  
Skittering.  
The sound doesn't just reach my ears - it travels through my jawbone, rattles down my vertebrae. Too many joints in those limbs. Too many claws clicking in flawless, arrhythmic syncopation.  
Vanity's warning hisses through my teeth: "You're walking directly into its flanking pattern."  
My lips curl. Let the beast believe it's the hunter here.

Something in the dark inhales.  
I rotate toward the sound—too slow for human reflexes, too precise for chance. The world sharpens as my pupils dilate, drinking in the darkness.  
Iron. Mold. Salt from sweat long dried into concrete. The scents hit me in layers, each one a roadmap. But underneath—rancid meat, wet fur—the Hollow Hound's breath still hangs in the air like spoiled honey.  
My boots crunch frozen gravel as I step forward. No hesitation. The HUD's ghostly markers flicker, but I don't need them. My skin prickles where the air currents shift around the creature's bulk. Twenty-two feet northeast. Moving counterclockwise.  
Skittering.  
The sound isn't just in my ears—it vibrates through my jawbone, down my spine. Too many joints in those limbs. Too many claws clicking in perfect, unnatural sync.  
Vanity's voice comes through clenched teeth: "You're walking right into its flanking pattern."  
I smile. Let it think it's hunting me.  
The Charge Rifle thrums in my hands, its whine harmonizing with the tinnitus ringing in my eardrums. I can taste the ozone from its coils.  
Come on then, I think, let's see which of us is more monster.  
The air curdled as the creature moved - that stench of putrid rot blooming thick enough to taste. My enhanced olfactory receptors burned with the stench of necrotic flesh and bile, each breath coating my tongue with the tang of spoiled meat and infection. The HUD's red marker pulsed in time with my quickening heartbeat.  
Time crystallized as adrenaline flooded my system. My modified nervous system fired at speeds no baseline human could comprehend. The Hollow Hound's charge became a series of still frames, haunches coiling like rusted springs, yellowed fangs gleaming under a sheen of saliva, claws scoring concrete as it launched  
My rifle rose in perfect synchrony with my breathing. The scope's reticle painted a perfect circle between its milky, pupil-less eyes. For a single glorious moment, everything was simple. Pure. The way the world should be - predator and prey, action and reaction.  
The shot tore through the underground like divine judgment. The recoil traveled up my arm in slow motion - first the sharp bite in my palms, then the delayed thunderclap of displaced air, finally the satisfying crunch as tungsten met bone. The stench of ozone overpowered even the creature's rot for one blessed second.  
My glasses adjusted automatically as gore rained down. The HUD helpfully outlined each major bone fragment in cheerful yellow, like some macabre children's puzzle. Chunks of decaying flesh slid down the walls with wet plops, the smell now multiplied tenfold by exposed viscera.  
Vanity's voice came through a haze of gunpowder and endorphins: "That was... thorough."  
I wiped a speck of brain matter from my cheek. "It won't get back up." The words came out half-laugh, half-growl. My enhanced hearing picked up the last twitches of its nervous system - wet, staccato pops of dying tissue.  
The rot would linger in my nostrils for hours. I found I didn't mind.  
"Vanity," I sigh, toeing a fragment of Hollow Hound skull across the concrete. The bone makes a hollow tink as it skitters away. "Contact Command. Target neutralized."  
"Got it." Her voice carries that particular lilt - the one that means she's smirking. I don't need enhanced hearing to know it.  
The winter air hits me like a slap as I climb out of the underground. My bag sits where I left it, innocuous as a landmine. I'm halfway through shouldering it when Vanity's voice crackles again:  
"Command requires callsign verification."  
My fingers lock on the zipper. Every. Damn. Time.  
"...Night Wolf." The words come out strangled. They taste like shame and bad decisions.  
Silence.  
Then, the inevitable:  
"No hunter registered under that designation." Vanity might as well be sipping tea. I can feel her delight vibrating through the comms.  
I stand statue-still. Snowflakes land on my burning cheeks and immediately dissolve. My pulse thrums in my ears, loud enough that Command could probably pick it up on their end. Somewhere in the universe, the cosmic joke that is my life is playing on loop.  
"Fine." My jaw aches from clenching. "Wolf... Burger."  
The pause that follows is nothing short of theatrical.  
"Identity confirmed," Vanity chirps. "Mission logged, Wolf Burger."  
I tear the earpiece out like it's on fire. The wind carries something suspiciously like giggles.  
The silence stretches, thick with my humiliation. Somewhere at Command, some desk jockey is undoubtedly leaning back in his chair, grinning like an idiot as he remembers the incident.  
The Incident being:

1. My enhanced taste buds turning a simple cheeseburger into a religious experience (thanks, Chimera Project)
2. Me devouring it in a supply closet like some feral animal (complete with actual growling)
3. The security footage - now legendary - of me mid-bite, cheese on my chin, eyes rolled back in ecstasy
4. The permanent, unshakable callsign now etched into my personnel file  
    I consider yeeting the earpiece into the next dimension. Instead, I unscrew my canteen and take an exaggerated swig - loud enough that every smug bastard at Command with enhanced hearing can taste my pettiness. The water does nothing to cleanse the lingering stench of dead cryptid. Or my dignity, currently lying in tatters at my feet.  
    Perfect. Just fucking perfect.
