### Chapter 40: Ghosts in the Mansion

"My parents never really cared about me."

The words hung in the cabin's quiet air, stark and simple amidst the fire's gentle crackle. Osyra sat on the rug, her back against the sofa, her ominous red eyes fixed on the flames. She was silent for a long moment, then glanced toward the window where Vanity stood watch. The android's perfect features showed no judgment, only the soft violet glow of patient observation.

"I guess you might judge me for complaining," Osyra muttered, her clawed fingers tracing patterns on the rug.

"I am in no position to judge anyone," Vanity replied, her tone as neutral as ever.

The acceptance felt like permission. Osyra's gaze returned to the fire, seeing other times in the flames.

"They lived in a mansion on the hill," she began again, her voice distant. "All white stone and perfect, silent lawns. I was a trophy. The brilliant daughter for the society pages." Her red eyes narrowed slightly. "There was a butler. Darian. He'd leave trays outside my door when I worked too late. A sandwich, milk. Sometimes a note: 'Don't forget to sleep, Miss Osyra.' I was too wrapped up in trying to earn my parents' attention to ever thank him properly."

The memory seemed to trigger another. "There was this girl in high school too. Taylor Mitts. We weren't friends - she was popular, I was... not. But sometimes she'd stop me in the hallway and ask, 'You okay, Renaya?' Just like that. I always brushed her off. Too proud."

Osyra's voice gained a strange energy as she continued. "There was this one day, my senior year. I went to a teen club. This older guy, maybe thirty but claiming twenty-two, was getting handsy with the DJ. I just... snapped. Picked up a cue ball and smashed his teeth in."

She looked at her hand, flexing it. "The DJ was this small Japanese girl named Yuki. Had crazy hair - blue on top, pink underneath. After that, she always let me pick my favorite song first when I came in. Didn't matter how busy it was."

Osyra found herself rambling now, the memories flowing freely. "From then on, it was different. In that dark, loud room, I wasn't the lonely rich girl anymore. I was the girl who'd stood up for the DJ. Yuki would play whatever I wanted - usually something loud and angry - and for those few hours, I felt... seen. In a way I never did anywhere else."

She shook her head, the memories fading. "Darian's kindness, Taylor's questions, Yuki's songs... they were all lifelines I was too proud to grab. Now look at me." She gestured at her altered form. "I became this... thing... trying to make myself impossible to ignore. Well, mission accomplished."

The fire popped. In the resulting silence, Osyra's voice grew quiet, vulnerable. "Vanity... am I a monster?"

The android didn't respond immediately. Her violet eyes seemed to process the question on levels far beyond a simple yes or no.

"Monsters," Vanity began, her voice measured, "are defined by their actions, not their appearance. A monster brings suffering without cause. A monster preys on the helpless." She turned her gaze fully to Osyra. "You protected a stranger from a predator. You remember the small kindnesses shown to you, even decades later. You hunt the things that truly prey on humanity."

She paused, her head tilting slightly. "Your body has been changed. Your life has been warped. But the person who saw injustice and intervened, the person who craved connection... she remains. That is not a monster. That is a soldier in a war she never asked to fight."

Osyra stared into the flames, Vanity's words settling deep within her. For the first time in a long time, the reflection she saw in her mind's eye wasn't of a creature, but of a woman who had stood up for a DJ with blue and pink hair, a woman who was still fighting, even when the battlefield had become her own body.
