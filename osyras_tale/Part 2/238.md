# Chapter 38 - Scars and Debriefs

The ride back to the Bastion was a silent, grim affair. The hard drive felt like a lead weight in Osyra's pack, its contents a poison she had already swallowed. The image of the Chupacabra—a flawed, terrified creature being ruthlessly culled by its more "perfect" successors—was burned into her mind. It was a stark metaphor for Elias's entire operation, and she knew with chilling certainty where she stood within it.

Back in her private quarters aboard the carrier, the first thing she did was strip off her dust-caked tactical gear and step into the shower. The hot water was a blessing, sluicing away the grime of the desert and the lingering psychic filth of the observatory. But the ritual that followed was one of grim necessity.

...Standing before the full-length mirror, her long black hair plastered dark and wet against her skin, she began her inspection. The water beaded on her light brown shoulders, tracing the contours of dense, powerful muscle that now defined her frame. The lupine features—the ears that twitched at the drip of a faucet, the tail that gave a single, reflexive flick—were now familiar, a part of her landscape. But she was looking for something else. Something new.

Her eyes, a luminous and ominous red in the stark light, scanned every inch of her reflection. They tracked over the smooth skin of her torso, down her powerful legs, searching for any new distortion—a patch of coarse fur where there shouldn't be, a claw that seemed longer and darker, a subtle shift in her skeletal structure. The files on Chimera-10 had spoken of "unstable integration" and "post-metamorphosis drift." Was her own form, the result of Chimera-9, truly stable? Or was she, like the Chupacabra, simply a prototype awaiting obsolescence?

She found nothing new. The body in the mirror was the same powerful, monstrously altered form she had grown accustomed to. For now. The relief was thin, tempered by the knowledge that Elias saw this body not as an end result, but as a stepping stone. Her own crimson gaze stared back from her human face, a constant reminder of the price of that transformation.

An hour later, cleaned and clad in a fresh, standard-issue uniform, she stood before Commander Kael in his office. Vanity was present, a silent, observant statue.

"The physical target was neutralized," Osyra began, her report crisp and professional. "The entity matched the 'Chupacabra' description. However, it was immediately engaged and eliminated by a pack of three Hollow Hounds upon our arrival."

Kael's cybernetic eye whirred softly. "They turned on their own?"

"Not their own," Osyra corrected. "An inferior product. The Hounds were sanitizing the area. The Chupacabra was a loose end, an unstable earlier prototype. They executed it with prejudice." She placed the hard drive on his desk. "We found this. A hidden archive. Project Chimera did not end with me. Elias has continued to Chimera-10. The Hounds are his mass-produced hunters and cleaners. He's seeding them at test sites."

Kael plugged the drive in, his face a stony mask as he scanned the summaries. The mention of "anomalous biological matrices" made his jaw tighten.

"He's graduated from playing God to playing with things he shouldn't," he muttered. He then opened the file on Layla Null. He read in silence for a full minute before looking up, his gaze sharp. "An immunity? A neutralizing agent?"

"That's his hypothesis," Osyra confirmed. "He doesn't want to hurt her. He needs her. She's the key to controlling what he's creating. She's the safety catch on a gun he's desperate to fire."

Vanity spoke, her voice cutting through the tension. "His reliance on her functionality increases her probability of survival. It also narrows the search parameters. He will require a facility capable of both containing a hostile biological subject and supporting advanced genetic research. The list of such locations is finite."

Kael leaned back, steepling his fingers. "This changes the calculus. We're no longer just containing outbreaks. We're in a race to find his central lab before he can fully weaponize this... this immunity." He looked from Osyra to Vanity. "You did good work out there. This is the first real break we've had. Get some rest. I'll have intelligence start cross-referencing potential lab sites. We're moving from cleanup to a direct assault on the source."

As they were dismissed, Osyra felt a shift in the air. The mission had just escalated. They were no longer hunters. They were soldiers being sent to storm the castle. And in its deepest dungeon, a girl with red hair was waiting, not just to be saved, but to be used as the ultimate weapon.
