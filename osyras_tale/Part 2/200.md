# Part 2

I am a hunter now.  
My prey is the stuff of nightmares—things that slither, things that scream, things that should never have been born. I go where the rules of nature fray, where the air itself hums with wrongness. My only companion is Vanity, an android who treats protocols as polite suggestions and orders as opening arguments.  
She watches me with eyes too calm, too knowing. A silent accusation: Brilliance has consequences. Some stains don't scrub clean, no matter how much blood you spill to wash them away.  
But once, I wore a lab coat instead of armor. Once, I led the Chimera Project—not with a rifle, but with a scalpel and a god complex. We didn't just cross lines; we burned them.  
Animal DNA spliced into human flesh.  
Monsters made to order.  
We called it progress.  
We succeeded.
