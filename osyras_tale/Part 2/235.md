# Chapter 35 - Unchained

The cry for help was a perfect, chilling mimicry of human fear, echoing through the dense pines. I pushed harder, my boots sinking into the soft loam, my tail lashing behind me for balance. Vanity's voice was a calm, remote presence in my ear.

'The signature is accelerating. It is no longer luring. It is hunting. Bearing directly for the two human heat signatures ahead. You will not intercept in time."

The two hunters. They'd wandered into the kill zone. The Wendigo had found easier prey.

I burst into a small clearing. The scene was frozen for a split second. The two men in orange vests, their backs to me, were staring, paralyzed, at the creature emerging from the treeline. It was taller and more gaunt than I had imagined, a thing of stretched, pallid skin and elongated limbs, moving with a skittering, insectile grace. Its head was a horrific fusion of bone and withered flesh, crowned with jagged antlers.

It ignored me. It saw the hunters.

I dropped to one knee, bringing the Charge Rifle to my shoulder. My wolf ears swiveled, tracking the slightest sound. The scope's reticle swam, then settled on the base of its skull. A kill shot. I took a breath, my finger tightening on the trigger.

It was faster than anything I'd ever seen.

It didn't turn. It simply vanished from my sights, a blur of grey motion. A moment later, the massive barrel of the Charge Rifle was wrenched sideways with a deafening crack of breaking composite. The force ripped the weapon from my hands, sending it skittering into the undergrowth. Numbness shot up my arms. A low growl rumbled in my chest without my conscious intent.

The Wendigo now stood between me and the hunters, its head tilted at an impossible angle, those black pit eyes fixed on me. It had known exactly where I was. The rifle had been the real threat. The hunters were just food.

It let out a rasping hiss and took a step toward the two men, who were finally stumbling backward, their screams choked with terror. I saw their eyes flicker from the monster to me, taking in the lupine ears flat against my head, the thick tail bristling behind me. Their terror now had two sources.

The Charge Rifle was gone. I drew my heavy pistol, firing twice into the creature's back. The rounds punched into its flesh with wet thuds, but it barely registered the impacts, its focus entirely on the fleeing hunters.

'It's ignoring secondary ballistics!" I yelled into the comms, my voice a snarl. 'I can't stop it!"

A hundred yards away, hidden in the trees, Vanity would be watching through the drone's camera, her processors calculating the inevitable outcome. The hunters would die. Then it would turn back to me.

There was a pause on the comms, then her voice returned, analytical yet decisive. 'The primary objective is the preservation of human life. The tactical parameters have been violated. I am moving to engage."

'Vanity, your position—!"

The transmission cut out.

The Wendigo was almost upon the hunters, its long, claw-tipped arms reaching. Then, a figure emerged from the trees at the far edge of the clearing. Vanity. She didn't run; she walked with a deliberate, unhurried pace that was more terrifying than a charge.

The creature sensed her. It stopped, its head rotating a full 180 degrees to face this new, scentless intrusion. It forgot the hunters, who scrambled away into the forest, their flight unnoticed.

It assessed her for a half-second, then lunged with the same blinding speed it had used on me. Claws that could shred metal swiped at her head.

Vanity didn't block. She didn't dodge. Her left hand snapped up and caught the creature's wrist in mid-air. The force of the impact didn't budge her an inch. There was an audible crack of bone.

The Wendigo shrieked, a sound of pure, alien fury. It tried to pull back, but her grip was absolute.

With her other hand, she reached out, not with a punch, but with an open palm. She placed it against the creature's torso. Then, with a simple, brutal shove, she ripped its arm clean from its socket.

The shriek became a gurgle. Black ichor fountained from the wound.

She didn't pause. She dropped the severed limb, stepped forward as the creature staggered, and grabbed its head with both hands. A sharp twist, another sickening crack, and the Wendigo collapsed into a twitching heap at her feet.

It was still moving. Vanity looked down, drew the Desert Eagle from her hip, and fired a single shot into the ruined skull. The twitching stopped.

Silence descended, broken only by the distant, fading cries of the hunters. I could still smell their panic on the wind.

Vanity stood over the carnage, her chassis spattered with black fluid. She holstered the massive pistol and turned her glowing violet eyes toward me. There was no triumph in her expression. No emotion at all. It was simply a task that had been completed.

My comms unit buzzed. It was Kael. His voice was sharp, but laced with stunned curiosity. 'Chimera One. Report. We have... highly excited transmissions from local hunters. They're describing... well, they're describing a lot of things. A wolf-woman and a metal angel. What's your status?"

I looked from the dismembered Wendigo to the perfectly calm android. My ears twitched, catching the distant whine of an approaching helicopter. The hunters had gotten a very clear look. 'The target is neutralized, Commander," I said, my own voice thick with adrenaline and awe. 'Vanity engaged. She... handled it. The witnesses are shaken, but safe. They saw everything."

There was a long pause on the other end. I could almost hear the gears turning in Kael's head, reassessing the value—and the exposure—of his assets. This wasn't a breach. This was a demonstration that would be very hard to explain.

'Understood," he said, his tone shifting to one of grim satisfaction. 'Secure the area. A cleanup and retrieval team is en route. Good work, Chimera One. And... tell your partner good work."

The connection died. I stood there, the silence of the woods pressing in. The hunt was over. Vanity had not caused a problem. She had simply revealed the sheer, astonishing scale of her power. And the two men running through the woods were now carrying a story that would blur the lines between monster and hunter forever.
