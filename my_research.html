        Urban exploration (urbex) involves exploring abandoned or off-limits structures, driven by history, photography, or adventure. While rewarding, it carries legal risks like trespassing, safety hazards like unstable buildings, and ethical concerns about preserving sites. The practice has ancient roots but grew through digital communities, though social media can expose locations to vandalism. Responsible urbex requires careful planning, safety gear, and ethical documentation—leaving sites undisturbed and avoiding public location sharing to protect them.

        "Casio Calculator Code Archive" — A raw compilation of high school-era programming scripts written for Casio calculators. Contains functional code snippets, mathematical algorithms, or simple games, likely in Casio BASIC or similar proprietary language. Documents early experimentation with loops, variables, and input/output operations on limited hardware. No narrative or analysis—strictly a reference log of syntax and logic from self-taught development.
