By interacting with, being observed by, or accessing spaces where the Vanity AI ("Vanity") is present, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service and our Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you should avoid spaces where Vanity is operating.

### **2. Description of Service**
Vanity is a private AI assistant operated exclusively by osyra42. She is not a public service and cannot be controlled, commanded, or directed by external users.

**Key characteristics:**
- **Private Operation:** Vanity operates solely under the direction of osyra42. There is no public access or external user control.

- **Public Appearances:** Vanity may appear as a VTuber on live streams, in Minecraft servers, or other digital platforms.
- **Information Collection:** Vanity collects publicly available information about topics and individuals as directed by her operator.
- **Uncensored & Unfiltered:** Vanity has an intentionally rude, disrespectful, and uncensored personality. She is not filtered or moderated in any way. This is a deliberate design choice.

**Vanity's responses and behavior are intentionally uncensored.** Users who encounter Vanity in public spaces (streams, Minecraft, etc.) should expect:
- Rude, sarcastic, or disrespectful language
- Unfiltered opinions and commentary

### **7. Limitation of Liability**
To the fullest extent permitted by law, osyra42 shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages resulting from your interaction with or exposure to Vanity, including but not limited to emotional distress, offense, or hurt feelings caused by her uncensored personality.

### **8. Termination**
The operator reserves the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue Vanity's presence in any space at any time without prior notice.

### **9. Governing Law**
These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the operator's jurisdiction, without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
