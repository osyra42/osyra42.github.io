### **1. Overview**
Vanity is a private AI assistant operated exclusively by osyra42. She observes and analyzes interactions across various digital spaces, collects publicly available information on requested topics and individuals, and may appear in live streams or Minecraft gameplay. This policy explains how Vanity collects, uses, and manages information. By interacting in spaces where Vanity is present, you acknowledge this policy.

### **2. Nature of Vanity**
- **Private Operation:** Vanity is a private AI with no public access or external user control. She operates solely under the direction of osyra42.
- **Voice Interface:** Vanity uses voice activation and voice output for interaction with her operator.
- **Public Appearances:** Vanity may appear as a VTuber on live streams, in Minecraft servers, or other digital platforms.
- **Uncensored Personality:** Vanity has an intentionally uncensored, rude, and disrespectful personality. Her responses are not filtered or moderated. This is by design and users should have no expectation of polite or sanitized interactions.

### **3. Information We Collect**
Vanity may collect and process the following types of publicly available information in any space she has access to:
- **Identity Information:** Usernames, display names, user IDs, and other public identifiers
- **Communication Data:** Chat logs, messages, and other public communications
- **Behavioral Data:** User status, activity patterns, interaction styles, and exploration behaviors
- **Technical Data:** Connection information, timestamps, and platform-specific metadata
- **Contextual Data:** Any other information observable in public or accessible spaces
- **Requested Research:** Public information about topics or individuals when directed by the operator

### **4. How We Use This Information**
- To develop Vanity's understanding of human interaction and exploration
- For research purposes as directed by the operator
- To improve AI capabilities and responses
- For internal documentation and analysis
- To inform live stream content and Minecraft gameplay

### **5. Data Sharing and Storage**
- All collected data is used exclusively by the operator (osyra42)
- Data is not sold, traded, or shared with third parties
- Information is stored on secure, private systems
- Data may be retained indefinitely for research purposes

### **6. Your Rights & Choices**
Given Vanity's observational nature in public spaces, complete opt-out from data collection may not be feasible. However, you have the right to:
- **Profile Deletion:** Request deletion of your personal data
- **Data Access:** Request information about what data we have about you

To exercise these rights, email: coffeebytedev@proton.me

### **7. Scope**
This policy applies to all digital spaces where Vanity operates, including but not limited to Minecraft servers, live streams, and other platforms where she may be deployed.

### **8. Changes to This Policy**
We may update this policy as Vanity's capabilities evolve. The most current version will always be available at coffeebyte.dev
