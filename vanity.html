This phase of the Vanity project resulted in a fully functional prototype. While the long-term vision included more complex AI interactions, this update successfully validated the core concept by delivering a working, interactive VTuber system.

Key Prototype Deliverables:

Real-time Twitch chat communication (read & reply system).

A dynamic VTuber model with responsive movement and controller support.

Integrated voice capabilities for user engagement.

The prototype served as a crucial proof-of-concept, demonstrating technical feasibility and informing the project's future roadmap.

I'm thrilled to share some major upgrades we've been working on for Vanity. These changes are all about speed, stability, and paving the way for future innovations. Here's what's new:

Key Improvements
New AI Backend: Vanity now runs on Llama 3.1 70B via Groq API, delivering faster, sharper, and more natural responses.

Enhanced Voice Conversations: A brand-new parsing algorithm makes interactions smoother and more intuitive.

Experimental Features: We're testing VB-Cable audio routing and controller input support—give them a try and share your feedback!

Current Focus (Testing Phase)
We're fine-tuning:

Voice stability (reducing delays for seamless conversations).

Controller responsiveness (optimizing for hands-on control).

What's Coming Next?
This update lays the groundwork for Vanity Ivy, featuring:

A modular design for easier updates.

Ultra-fast voice responses.

Seamless input/output handling.

Important Note
To ensure peak performance, we've fully removed the old GPT4All and Ollama backends. This keeps Vanity lean, efficient, and ready for future upgrades.

We can't wait to hear your thoughts—let us know how the new features work for you!

I'm thrilled to announce the latest update for the bot, which introduces some significant changes and improvements! Here's what you can expect:

1. **Model Update**: I'm now utilizing the **Dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b** model, which promises enhanced performance and more accurate responses. This model is designed to provide a better user experience with improved AI capabilities.

2. **Switch to Ollama**: In this update, I've transitioned from GPT4All to Ollama for much better performance. This change is expected to significantly enhance the bot's responsiveness and overall efficiency.

3. **Removed Cogs and Simplification Functions**: To streamline the bot's operation and improve response times, I've removed certain cogs and functions that were intended to simplify the development process and allow for expansion.

4. **Fixed Slash Commands and AI Response Disconnect Issues**: I've addressed and resolved issues related to slash commands and AI response disconnects, ensuring a smoother and more reliable user experience.

5. **Voice Module Removal**: After careful consideration, I've decided to remove the voice module output to Discord. The process was simply too slow and did not meet the desired performance standards.

This update aims to simplify the bot and get core functionalities back up and running smoothly, while also leveraging the new model and Ollama for better performance. Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to improve the bot's performance and reliability.

I'm excited to share a small but impactful update for the bot! Here's what's new:

1. **Model Update**: I'm now using the **nous-hermes-2-solar-10.7b.Q5_K_M** model. This model introduces various ways the bot can reply based on the roles the user might have, enhancing the interaction experience.

2. **Hardware Upgrade**: I've upgraded the PC Vanity is running on to include 64GB of RAM. This upgrade will significantly help with larger models, ensuring smoother and more efficient performance.

3. **Role-Based Responses**: The new model allows for more dynamic and context-aware responses, tailored to the roles users have within the Discord server.

4. **Speech Capabilities**: This update still utilizes OpenVoice for speech synthesis, ensuring that the bot can continue to provide spoken responses.

This update, though small, brings notable improvements to the bot's capabilities and performance. Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to enhance the bot's functionality.

I'm thrilled to announce the fifth iteration of Vanity Bot, and it's a massive update! This version represents a complete overhaul of the bot, with significant changes and exciting new features.

Key Features:

1. Switch to Python:
We've transitioned the entire codebase from JavaScript to Python. This change allows us to leverage Python's powerful libraries and frameworks, enabling more sophisticated and efficient development.

2. AI-Powered Responses:
We've integrated GPT4All with the Nous-Hermes-2-solar-10.7b model to power Vanity's responses. This AI model provides more intelligent, contextually relevant, and dynamic interactions, making conversations with Vanity feel more natural and engaging.

3. Voice Responses:
In addition to text responses, Vanity now uses OpenVoice to generate voice responses. This means that all of Vanity's replies are voiced, adding a new layer of interactivity and immersion.

4. Multiple Personalities:
We've introduced the ability for Vanity to switch between different "personalities" based on user roles. This feature allows for more tailored and varied interactions, making Vanity feel more versatile and adaptable.

5. Removed Minecraft Playing:
Unfortunately, we had to remove the Minecraft playing feature to focus on the core improvements and new functionalities. However, we're exploring ways to reintroduce similar features in the future.

This update marks a significant leap forward in making Vanity a more intelligent, interactive, and versatile bot. We're excited to see how these new features will enhance your experience with the bot.

Stay tuned for more updates and improvements. Your feedback is crucial, so please don't hesitate to share your thoughts and suggestions!

I'm thrilled to announce the second iteration of Vanity Bot! In this update, we've introduced some exciting new features that make the bot more interactive and responsive.

Key Features:

1. Regex-Based Message Recognition:
Vanity can now recognize specific patterns in messages using regular expressions (regex). When a matching pattern is detected, the bot responds with a randomized reply, making interactions more dynamic and engaging.

2. Interactive Commands:
We've added a few new commands that enhance user interaction:
    
    Announcement Repeater: The bot can now repeat announcements or important messages, ensuring they get the attention they deserve.
