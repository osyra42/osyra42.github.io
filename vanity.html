I'm thrilled to announce the latest update for the bot, which introduces some significant changes and improvements! Here's what you can expect:

1. **Model Update**: I'm now utilizing the **Dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b** model, which promises enhanced performance and more accurate responses. This model is designed to provide a better user experience with improved AI capabilities.

2. **Switch to Ollama**: In this update, I've transitioned from GPT4All to Ollama for much better performance. This change is expected to significantly enhance the bot's responsiveness and overall efficiency.

3. **Removed Cogs and Simplification Functions**: To streamline the bot's operation and improve response times, I've removed certain cogs and functions that were intended to simplify the development process and allow for expansion.

4. **Fixed Slash Commands and AI Response Disconnect Issues**: I've addressed and resolved issues related to slash commands and AI response disconnects, ensuring a smoother and more reliable user experience.

5. **Voice Module Removal**: After careful consideration, I've decided to remove the voice module output to Discord. The process was simply too slow and did not meet the desired performance standards.

This update aims to simplify the bot and get core functionalities back up and running smoothly, while also leveraging the new model and Ollama for better performance. Thank you for your continued support and patience as I work to improve the bot's performance and reliability.
