# Lesson 03: Strings

A large amount of information out there consists of text. A piece of text data is called a **string**.

In this lesson, you'll work with text data.

## Creating Strings

Strings in Python need to be surrounded by quotation marks.

```python
"The Lord of the Rings"
```

We use quotation marks to tell Python that we are working with a piece of text data. Strings can be stored in variables.

```python
company = "Apple"
```

A variable is storing a string if the value is surrounded by quotation marks.

## Single vs Double Quotes

In Python, both single `'` and double `"` quotes can be used to define strings. It doesn't make a difference whether you choose double or single quotation marks.

The quotation marks just need to match.

```python
month = 'April'
```

---

## Multiple Statements

A computer program is made of lines of code. You can add as many lines and variables to your code as you need to give the computer instructions.

```python
movie = "Jurassic Park"
director = "Steven Spielberg"
```

The code in computer programs is made of **statements**. Statements are the instructions for the computer to follow. Real programs can contain thousands of statements.

```python
book = "Harry Potter"
author = "J. K. Rowling"
```

This code has **2** statements.

## Printing Values

The `print()` statement is the easiest way to send a value to the screen.

```python
print("Iceland")
```

This will display: `Iceland`

---

## Creating vs Printing

```python
country = "Iceland"
```

This code **creates a variable** — it does not display anything on screen.

## Lesson Takeaways

Well done! You learned that:

- A piece of text is called a **string**
- Strings require quotation marks
- The `print()` statement is used to send a value to the screen

In the next lesson, you'll learn about other types of data.
