# Lesson 02: Variables

Computer programs use variables to remember important information, like items in a shopping cart, prices and discounts.

The line of code below tells the computer to store information in a variable called `item`.

```python
item = "bike"
```

## Creating Variables

To create a variable, you just need to give it a name. The information that you need to store is added on the right.

```python
item = "phone"
```

Variables have a name and a value. They are connected with the equal sign `=`.

```python
item = "watch"
```

```python
country = "France"
```

---

## Variable Names

You can think of a variable as a box that contains some information.

```python
city = "New York"
```

- **variable name:** city
- **variable value:** "New York"

Humans use code to give instructions to computers, but the code will also be read by other humans (and future you!). Choose descriptive variable names.

```python
message = "Level Up"
```

- **variable name:** message
- **variable value:** "Level Up"

## Key Concepts

- True or False? Computers can store and recall information faster and more accurately than humans — **True**
- Computer programs can store information like the user's progress in a videogame with **variables**

## Lesson Takeaways

Amazing job! You learned that:

- Computer programs use variables to remember important information
- A variable has a name and a value
- You can create a variable by connecting the name and the value with an equal sign `=`

In the next lesson, you'll start writing and running real code.
