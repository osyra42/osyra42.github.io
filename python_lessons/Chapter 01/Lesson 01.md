# Lesson 01: Introduction to Python & print()

Python is one of the most popular and useful languages used to give instructions to computers. In this course, you'll learn to write programs to automate and speed up tasks.

Python has a simple syntax which means it's easy to write, read and learn!

```python
print("Welcome")
```

## The print() Statement

The `print()` instruction is the easiest way to send a message to the screen or other display device.

```python
print("Level Up!")
```

The `print()` instruction requires the use of parentheses around the message.

```python
print("Level Up!")
```

---

## Quotation Marks

Humans use code to give instructions to machines.

Make sure you use quotation marks around text messages.

```python
print("Now playing ...")
```

If you miss the quotation marks around the text, the computer won't understand your instructions.

```python
print("Turn left")
```

---

## Numbers

Numbers don't require quotation marks.

```python
print(42)
```

## Lesson Takeaways

Amazing job! Python is widely used to build software and games, analyze data and program Artificial Intelligence. You learned that:

- Humans use code to give instructions to machines
- The `print()` instruction displays a message on the screen

In the next lesson, you'll learn to write code to store important information.
