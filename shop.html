Custom VTuber Model Development in VRM Format

Establish a distinct presence in the virtual space with a custom avatar. At Coffee Byte Dev, I specialize in the creation of bespoke VTuber models in the universal VRM format, designed for streaming, content creation, and digital interaction.

The Value of a Custom Avatar

Your model serves as your digital identity. A custom creation offers several key advantages:

Unique Brand Identity: Differentiate yourself with a design that is exclusively yours.

Enhanced Viewer Engagement: Convey emotion and intent through dynamic, high-fidelity expressions and movements.

Professional Quality: A well-crafted model adds a layer of polish and credibility to your content.

Software Compatibility: VRM models are supported by a wide range of popular applications, including VSeeFace and VirtualCast, ensuring broad usability.

Service Overview

I develop fully rigged and performance-ready VTuber models from the ground up. The process includes:

Custom 3D Design: Collaborative development from initial concept to finalized 3D asset.

Professional Rigging: Implementation of skeletal rigging for body movement, along with blendshapes for smooth facial expressions, eye tracking, and lip-sync.

VRM Export and Optimization: Final models are delivered in the VRM format, optimized for stable performance and compatibility with standard VTuber software.
