# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static personal website for Coffee Byte Dev (coffeebyte.dev), hosted on GitHub Pages. The site is a portfolio and content hub featuring educational tools, creative writing, project showcases, and mini-games.

## Architecture

### Core Structure
- **Root HTML pages**: Main site pages (index.html, commissions.html, donate.html, etc.)
- **assets/**: Shared resources for the main site
  - `css/styles.css`: Main stylesheet with coffee-themed CSS variables
  - `js/sidebar.js`: Dynamic sidebar generation with navigation links
  - `js/scripts.js`: General utilities and clutter toggle functionality
  - `js/md2html.js`: Markdown-to-HTML converter for inline markdown content
  - `js/mobile.js`: Mobile-specific handling
  - `clutter-main/clutter.js`: Visual clutter effect

### Key Subsections
- **school/**: Educational worksheet generators
  - Self-contained pages with inline CSS (not using main stylesheet)
  - Canvas-based procedural worksheet generators (math, writing, PE)
  - Each worksheet is a standalone HTML file with embedded JavaScript

- **fishing_mini_game/**: Browser-based fishing game
  - Modular JS architecture: config.js -> state.js -> terrain.js -> player.js -> fishing.js -> input.js -> render.js -> main.js
  - Script load order matters (defined in index.html)
  - Uses HTML5 Canvas for rendering

- **osyras_tale/**: Markdown story content organized by Parts and Characters

## Design System

CSS variables defined in `:root` follow a coffee theme:
- Background colors: `--espresso`, `--dark-mocha`, `--dark-chocolate`
- Text colors: `--steamed-milk`, `--light-cream`, `--half-and-half`
- Accent colors: `--caramel`, `--pumpkin-spice`, `--mocha`

Custom font "Peppermint Pen" used for headings and navigation.

## Sidebar System

The sidebar is dynamically generated by `sidebar.js` using a data-driven approach:
- Links are defined in `linksData` array with section, href, text, icon, and updateDate
- Items show "NEW" badge if updated within 14 days (configurable via `DAYS_TO_KEEP_NEW`)
- Each page must define `image` and `title` variables in a script tag before sidebar.js loads

## Deployment

This is a GitHub Pages site:
- Domain: coffeebyte.dev (configured via CNAME file)
- Changes pushed to main branch deploy automatically
- No build step required - all content is static HTML/CSS/JS
